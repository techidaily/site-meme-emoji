<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme</h2><p>Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won’t necessarily make this meme as effective as you’d like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.</p>
<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-3"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme</h2><p>Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won’t necessarily make this meme as effective as you’d like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.</p>
<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

<p>Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald’s. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”</p>
<p>They’ve also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions’ abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.</p>
<p>A <strong>Minion meme</strong> is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one’s cooking.</p>

They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.</p>

<p>Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald’s. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”</p>
<p>They’ve also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions’ abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.</p>
<p>A <strong>Minion meme</strong> is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one’s cooking.</p>
<p>Leading with the fact, we’ll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.</p>

It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, <strong>Pierre Coffin</strong>. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.</p>
<p>There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.</p>

<p>All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis. Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.</p>

However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>

<p>Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>

The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>

<p>Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years.

The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Create-Animoji-or-Memoji-Videos-3"><a href="#Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Create-Animoji-or-Memoji-Videos-3" class="headerlink" title="Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos"></a>Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos</h2><p>Even though recording thirty-second animoji and memoji videos with iPhone X, iPhone XS or iPad Pro is a quick and simple process, the time limit is still a huge obstacle to social media content creators who want to create animoji and memoji videos that surpass that limit. Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.</p>
<h4 id="1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces-3"><a href="#1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Emoji Me Animated Faces"></a>1. Emoji Me Animated Faces</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.</p>
<h4 id="2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder-3"><a href="#2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder-3" class="headerlink" title="2. EMOJI Face Recorder"></a>2. EMOJI Face Recorder</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Android</p>
<p>You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.</p>
<h4 id="3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar-3"><a href="#3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar"></a>3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes. The app lets you customize all of your facial features, and pick the shape of your nose, the color of your eyes or the accessories you want to add to the fictional character you’re creating. Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.</p>
<h4 id="4-Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App-3"><a href="#4-Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Supermoji – The Emoji App"></a>4. Supermoji – The Emoji App</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p><img

                      alt="what-is-emoji"
                ></p>
<p>This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>
<h4 id="5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters-3"><a href="#5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters-3" class="headerlink" title="5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters"></a>5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Android</p>
<p>Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>
<h4 id="6-MSQRD-3"><a href="#6-MSQRD-3" class="headerlink" title="6. MSQRD"></a>6. MSQRD</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung AR Emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Samsung Galaxy series.</p>
<p>Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

<p>Animoji and memoji videos have become one of the hottest trends on social media in a relatively short period of time.

<h2 id="The-Things-You-Need-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme"><a href="#The-Things-You-Need-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme" class="headerlink" title="The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme"></a>The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme</h2><p> Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let’s get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.</p>
<h4 id="1-A-Triggered-Template"><a href="#1-A-Triggered-Template" class="headerlink" title="1. A Triggered Template"></a>1. A Triggered Template</h4><p> You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en_US" >Triggered Meme Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.</p>
<h4 id="2-A-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#2-A-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. A Video Editing Software"></a>2. A Video Editing Software</h4><p> Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.</p>
<h4 id="3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme"><a href="#3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme" class="headerlink" title="3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme"></a>3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme</h4><p> This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music and sounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint"><a href="#Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint" class="headerlink" title="Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint"></a>Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint</h2><p> Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.</p>
<p> Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-2"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Triggered Meme?"></a>How to Make a Triggered Meme?</h2><p> Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.</p>
<h4 id="1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project"><a href="#1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project" class="headerlink" title="1. Adding Media to a Project"></a>1. Adding Media to a Project</h4><p> Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.</p>
<h4 id="2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the Green Screen Effect"></a>2. Using the Green Screen Effect</h4><p> Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.</p>
<h4 id="3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects"><a href="#3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects"></a>3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects</h4><p> In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.</p>
<p> After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme"><a href="#4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme"></a>4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme</h4><p> Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.</p>
<p> Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.</p>
<h4 id="4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora"><a href="#4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora"></a>4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora</h4><p> When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.</p>
<p> The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends.

<h2 id="The-Things-You-Need-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-1"><a href="#The-Things-You-Need-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-1" class="headerlink" title="The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme"></a>The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme</h2><p> Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let’s get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.</p>
<h4 id="1-A-Triggered-Template-1"><a href="#1-A-Triggered-Template-1" class="headerlink" title="1. A Triggered Template"></a>1. A Triggered Template</h4><p> You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en_US" >Triggered Meme Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.</p>
<h4 id="2-A-Video-Editing-Software-1"><a href="#2-A-Video-Editing-Software-1" class="headerlink" title="2. A Video Editing Software"></a>2. A Video Editing Software</h4><p> Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.</p>
<h4 id="3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme-1"><a href="#3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme-1" class="headerlink" title="3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme"></a>3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme</h4><p> This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music and sounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint-1"><a href="#Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint-1" class="headerlink" title="Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint"></a>Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint</h2><p> Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.</p>
<p> Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Triggered Meme?"></a>How to Make a Triggered Meme?</h2><p> Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.</p>
<h4 id="1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-1"><a href="#1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Adding Media to a Project"></a>1. Adding Media to a Project</h4><p> Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.</p>
<h4 id="2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1"><a href="#2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the Green Screen Effect"></a>2. Using the Green Screen Effect</h4><p> Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.</p>
<h4 id="3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-1"><a href="#3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects"></a>3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects</h4><p> In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.</p>
<p> After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-1"><a href="#4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme"></a>4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme</h4><p> Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.</p>
<p> Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.</p>
<h4 id="4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora-1"><a href="#4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora"></a>4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora</h4><p> When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.</p>
<p> The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p> It is no secret that we all lose our cool from time. It’s only natural, after all, the world can be a frustrating place. We’re all enraged by different things, some of us can’t stand pineapple on pizza while others explode when being pranked. What we often don’t realize is that being triggered in front of a camera makes us perfect meme material. Even though the majority of memes are still images, some of the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >most memorable memes <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> ever created were <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >GIFs or short videos. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>

<h2 id="The-Things-You-Need-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-3"><a href="#The-Things-You-Need-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme"></a>The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme</h2><p> Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let’s get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.</p>
<h4 id="1-A-Triggered-Template-3"><a href="#1-A-Triggered-Template-3" class="headerlink" title="1. A Triggered Template"></a>1. A Triggered Template</h4><p> You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en_US" >Triggered Meme Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.</p>
<h4 id="2-A-Video-Editing-Software-3"><a href="#2-A-Video-Editing-Software-3" class="headerlink" title="2. A Video Editing Software"></a>2. A Video Editing Software</h4><p> Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.</p>
<h4 id="3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme-3"><a href="#3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme"></a>3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme</h4><p> This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music and sounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint-3"><a href="#Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint-3" class="headerlink" title="Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint"></a>Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint</h2><p> Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.</p>
<p> Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-5"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-5" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Triggered Meme?"></a>How to Make a Triggered Meme?</h2><p> Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.</p>
<h4 id="1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-3"><a href="#1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Adding Media to a Project"></a>1. Adding Media to a Project</h4><p> Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.</p>
<h4 id="2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3"><a href="#2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the Green Screen Effect"></a>2. Using the Green Screen Effect</h4><p> Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.</p>
<h4 id="3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-3"><a href="#3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects"></a>3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects</h4><p> In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.</p>
<p> After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-3"><a href="#4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme"></a>4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme</h4><p> Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.</p>
<p> Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.</p>
<h4 id="4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora-3"><a href="#4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora"></a>4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora</h4><p> When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.</p>
<p> The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends. What’s your favorite method of making memes?</p>
