Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-select-image.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-background.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid Background"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>

Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-select-image.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-background.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid Background"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>

Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully.

Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>

<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is.

</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important.

<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>

<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important.

<p> The Distracted Boyfriend meme is the embodiment of the awkward situation we find ourselves in when we want something other than what we already have. The original image was taken by Antonio Guillem and posted on iStock with a caption “Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl”. By early 2017, a few years after it was posted on iStock, the picture surfaced on social media, and it became a viral meme in a few short months. One of the first Distracted Boyfriend memes that featured a joke about staring at the sun during a solar eclipse was posted on Reddit and within 24 hours it gained 31.200 points.</p>

<p>Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.</p>
<p>So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.</p>

It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.</p>
<p>The funniest subreddits on &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read “Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there’s nobody else there.”&#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as “there’s someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead.”</p>

There’s no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.</p>
<p>For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.</p>

To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.</p>
<p>You won’t find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, “Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don’t be said. I’ll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you.” Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you’re on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It’s free and open-source. In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>
<p>The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>
<h4 id="3-Plot"><a href="#3-Plot" class="headerlink" title="3. Plot"></a><strong>3. Plot</strong></h4><p>Price: $10&#x2F;month (14 days Free Trial Available)</p>

                      alt="plot-poster"
                ></p>
<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.</p>
<p>The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.</p>
<p>For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.</p>
<p>Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it’s right for you, but there is no commitment involved.</p>

In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.</p>
<p>Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you’re ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-16"><a href="#Conclusion-16" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.</p>
<p>If you’re working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you’re done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>

Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>

Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-19"><a href="#Conclusion-19" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>
