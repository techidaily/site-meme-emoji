In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.</p>
<h3 id="The-significant-elements-are"><a href="#The-significant-elements-are" class="headerlink" title="The significant elements are:"></a><strong>The significant elements are:</strong></h3><ul>
<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>
</ul>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Photo-Collage-in-iPhoto-1"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Photo-Collage-in-iPhoto-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?</h2><p>Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

Filmora can do this for you, through which you can easily crop, add effects, split the screen, and merge photos. In order to make the “photo video” lively and exciting, you can also add music, audio, animation, title, music, etc. to it.</p>

Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files</h4><p>Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.</p>

To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.</p>

<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

<h4 id="Step-2-Add-Music-to-Your-iMovie-Slideshow-Project"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Music-to-Your-iMovie-Slideshow-Project" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project"></a>Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project</h4><p>Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.</p>
<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video</h4><p>iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.</p>
<p>If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It’s a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.</p>

<h4 id="1-Create-a-New-Project-3"><a href="#1-Create-a-New-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Create a New Project"></a>1. Create a New Project</h4><p>After launching iMovie, click the Project button and then click Create New. Select Movie to combine photos, videos and music to make a slideshow.</p>
<p><img

<h4 id="2-Import-Photos-Videos-and-Audio-Files-3"><a href="#2-Import-Photos-Videos-and-Audio-Files-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files"></a>2. Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files</h4><p>Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.</p>

Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust</h4><p>Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.</p>
<h4 id="4-Apply-Transitions-Effects-3"><a href="#4-Apply-Transitions-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Apply Transitions &amp; Effects"></a>4. Apply Transitions &amp; Effects</h4><p>Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.</p>

<p>I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.</p>
<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-3"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project"></a>Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project</h4><p>Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.</p>
<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video</h4><p>iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.</p>
<p>If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It’s a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.</p>
