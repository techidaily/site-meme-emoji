## Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?

While you are dealing with the digital creative aspect, you need to have a subject line, plan, execution components, camera and knowledge about running the camera to show its movements. In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.

However, even for the beginner, the home could be the best option instead of a studio.

#### 1.Everyday Play Items

**For Kids**

Kids love to play with toys. But every day playing with the same toys brings boredom. Being a responsible parent, you must eradicate their boredom to teach him/them how to make stop motion with their daily playing toys. Place the toys over a table, fix the angle and place your mobile phone camera and start slow-moving and on and off the camera. It's fun for kids to create something different that can go online.

**For Beginners**

Take a basket, collect a few items from your daily use like pin, comb, paperweight, vegetable cutter, knife, stationery items on the table. You can adjust your home lights and set your mobile camera or DSLR on the tripod. Create something based on your thought process with the objects, start on or off the camera and make a little move to create the animation over the video.

The process is quite basic yet useful to know the camera angles, the lights, and shadow collaboration to create the magic.

#### 2.Lego stop motion

Lego is the legendary name in stop motion animation. The brick-style square figures or brickfilms your kid can create to lego stop motion. The creativity is unlimited, and your kid can express any story using lego animation.

#### 3.Claymation

**For Kids**

You will get clay toys in every household and every kid's wardrobe. Every kid can prepare a figure out of those colorful clay bumps stored in their collection. If you hold the camera at an apt angle, place any clay figures and start camera roll on and off, a beautiful clip you can make.

**For Beginners**

You can make clay figures without hands or legs and make moves. Use a tripod and place it in front of those clay figures, put the lights on and start rolling the camera. The clays can depict a story without much of your efforts and involvement. The plus point of the claymation is you can use the same clay and make hundreds of stop motions and show the magic over the camera.

#### 4.Whiteboard stop motion for kids

If your kids are good at sketching or drawing, or painting, a whiteboard becomes a great idea to make stop motion. The shape and size of the whiteboard give you enough space to draw a story and show it to your audience.

**For beginners:** A small sketch by a marker on the whiteboard, use the white space, place the camera on the tripod and start to roll on. The major plus point to using a whiteboard is the spacious object and the sketch you draw over the board. You can easily brief the subject line, using figures, characters and make a super stop motion to feed your creativity.

#### 5.Sticky Notes stop motion for kids

You can create a sticky notes game or figures if you want to use the sticky notes board. Once you get the idea, you will never feel bored playing with sticky notes and create stop motion. But for the kids, it's high-level creativity that needs attention and support from your elders.

**For beginners:** The notes can be a great idea to draw a story or the game we used to play in our childhood. You can add voiceover or the music at the time of final editing. The movement of the notes with the rhythm and music create a perfect stop motion for your beginning journey.

#### 6.Paper-cut out stop motion idea for kids

The paper-cut-out stop motion is an interesting animation that easily grabs the watchers' attention. You can prepare figures and characters by cutting papers or directly cutting figures from magazines, newspapers, and books and creating stop motion animation.

**For the beginners:** It could be really fun to cut the figures from books, magazines, newspapers and make the story and give the animation form. Here it would help if you held the camera from the top of the object to avoid the shadow. The playful manner of shadow and light is a very important thing in paper-cut-out stop motion. The camera position would decide how beautiful your stop motion creation will be. Perfect practice for beginners at home.

#### 7.Floor motion or chalkboard motion for kids

The school classroom becomes our best play area if teachers are not around. Black or green boards become the best drawing space with white and colorful chalk. The same stance we can apply on the floor. You can draw figures and move on the floor and shoot. As a kid, you can take the help from your elder and create the motion of your choice.

#### 8.Boing Claymation or Replacement for kids

Boing claymation intrigues laughter if you can add good sound effects. Though kids prefer the replacement stop motion, it is a funny animation if you manage to create. Lots of creativity and lesser arrangements are required to make this category stop motion animation.

**For the Beginners:** If you try your hands to make some funny animation based on objects available at home, Boing claymation is the best option to start working on it. The objects you set need to move from one place to another and shoot at from a distance.

#### 9.Human and shadow stop motion for kids

The most engaging stop motion ever is when you can use the human body and the shadow reflection to create the animation.

This category stop motion idea is to get concrete formation if you know how to set your device camera to click or shoot every time interval. The time setting is called timelapse, and it captures the movement of the object or formation of the object and captures the transformation or change. Being a kid, it's great creativity to set the camera and capture those moments to create timelapse.

**For beginners:** In the professional world, several ad agencies take the help of time-lapse to show the transformation and the slow changes of the object they select. The transformation depicts a story that could frame on a device. The shoot will be on the time interval to frame the entire change.

#### 11.Fruit stop motion ideas for kids

## Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.

However, even for the beginner, the home could be the best option instead of a studio.

If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

## Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?

While you are dealing with the digital creative aspect, you need to have a subject line, plan, execution components, camera and knowledge about running the camera to show its movements. In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis.

On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes. The app lets you customize all of your facial features, and pick the shape of your nose, the color of your eyes or the accessories you want to add to the fictional character you’re creating. Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.

#### 4. Supermoji – The Emoji App

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

![what-is-emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora.

Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button.

Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it. You can then adjust its duration, position on the screen or size. Optionally, you can double-click on the emoji to access the Motion tab that enables you to choose between different motion effects.

![Add Animated Emoji   from Filmstock to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-emoji-elements-from-Filmstock.jpg)

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from [Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

The process of adding the emojis from this pack to videos is the same as the process of adding one of the emojis from the built-in Emojis category. Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully.
