![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)

Gamers, YouTubers and all other Mac and PC users who’d like to add a smiley or any other emoji to a video should try processing their footage with the Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it.

Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button.

Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free. You should keep in mind that emojis can have different meanings in different cultures, which is the reason why you must make sure that the emoji you’re adding to your video isn’t inappropriate or offensive in the context in which you’re using it. It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button.

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

#### 5. Add Titles and Text

Using some opener titles and credits at the beginning and ending part of your slideshow will make it cool as well. You can add some famous quotes and words to better demonstrate.

Just to the Titles tab and select one of the title templates and drop it to the timeline first and then write your own words in the preview window.

#### 6. Add Music to Slideshow

You can download some royalty-free music and sound effects from websites such as [Filmstock stock media library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or iTunes or import your own audio as we said before to use it as the slideshow background music. To sync with the slideshow, you may need to trim and edit the audio accordingly. For detailed information about iMovie audio editing, you can check [how to add background music to iMovie.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7. Export and Share Your Slideshow video

Play the slideshow and check the result in the preview window. If everything goes well, you can now export and share or save it. You can save the slideshow video in MP4 format, or share it to Vimeo or add the slideshow to Theater to load it on your other Apple devices so you can easily watch it on your iOS devices or Apple TV.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

#### Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library

iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either "File/Import" or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

#### Step 3. Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video

iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It's a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.
