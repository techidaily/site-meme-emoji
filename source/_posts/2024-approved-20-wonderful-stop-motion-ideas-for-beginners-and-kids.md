#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

#### Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library

iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either "File/Import" or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/select-photos-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

It provides a simple yet professional way to make slideshow movies from your photos, videos, and music.

If you haven’t iMovie installed on your Mac yet, just go to iTunes and download it for free. In the following part, I’ll share with you the step-by-step tutorial on how to make a slideshow on Mac using the free video editing software iMovie.

If you are an iOS user, check our picks of [best photo slideshow apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for iPhone or iPad.

## Ways for iMovie Photo Slideshow with Music Making

To make a photo slideshow with music in iMovie, you can follow these steps.

#### 1. Create a New Project

After launching iMovie, click the Project button and then click Create New. Select Movie to combine photos, videos and music to make a slideshow.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-create-new-project.jpg)

#### 2. Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files

Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-import-slideshow-photos-videos.jpg)

#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-transitions-library.jpg)

#### 5. Add Titles and Text

Using some opener titles and credits at the beginning and ending part of your slideshow will make it cool as well. You can add some famous quotes and words to better demonstrate.

Just to the Titles tab and select one of the title templates and drop it to the timeline first and then write your own words in the preview window.

#### 6. Add Music to Slideshow

You can download some royalty-free music and sound effects from websites such as [Filmstock stock media library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or iTunes or import your own audio as we said before to use it as the slideshow background music. To sync with the slideshow, you may need to trim and edit the audio accordingly. For detailed information about iMovie audio editing, you can check [how to add background music to iMovie.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Filmstock-stock-media-library-banner.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7. Export and Share Your Slideshow video

Play the slideshow and check the result in the preview window. If everything goes well, you can now export and share or save it. You can save the slideshow video in MP4 format, or share it to Vimeo or add the slideshow to Theater to load it on your other Apple devices so you can easily watch it on your iOS devices or Apple TV.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

#### Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library

iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either "File/Import" or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/add-backgound-music-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 3. Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video

iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It's a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

#### Step 3. Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video

iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It's a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.

First, let's check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

Read this article to learn more about Animoji: [The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

## List of iPhones and iPads that Support Animojis and Memojis

| Face ID                             | Animoji                             | Memoji                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| iPhone X                            | iPhone X                            | iPhone X (iOS 12 or later required) |

| iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) | iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) | iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) |

Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.

**The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features**

Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.

#### Supermoji – The Emoji App

A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

See best Memoji makers here: [Top 8 Memoji Makers to Make a Memoji on PC, Android, and iPhone.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

Read this article to learn more about Animoji: [The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.
