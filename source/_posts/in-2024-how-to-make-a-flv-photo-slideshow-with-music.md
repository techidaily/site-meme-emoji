Plus, the option to create a custom Slack emoji makes it more interesting. You can use it to create a new and unique Slack emoji to personalize your chatting experience. Why write long texts when you can just add Slack emoji to say it all?

Let me show you the ropes on how to create a custom Slack emoji and make your chatting experience more fun.

* [Bonus Tip-Edit Emoji and Add Emoji to Your Video](#part3)

## Part 1: How to Add Slack Emoji

At Slack, you can find a Slack emoji for every emotion or occasion. Finding the perfect Slack emoji is as easy as browsing through the categorized sections. Better yet, the option to search for a Slack emoji makes it a cakewalk to get the exact Slack emoji to express oneself.

Also, you can add Slack emoji with a single tap. And it allows you to add unlimited Slack emoji in one message.

Let me show you how to add Slack emoji in a few quick steps:

1.Download and open Slack on your desktop or smartphone.
