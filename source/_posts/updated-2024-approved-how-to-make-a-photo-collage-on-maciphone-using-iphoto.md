iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

### Alternative to Make a Short Video, Slideshow, or Photo Collage: Wondershare Filmora

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

## Bonus Tip—Memoji VS Emoji

Now you must be wondering what the difference between a memoji and emoji is. Well, there is the first major difference, which is that a memoji is the cartoon avatar of you, whereas an emoji is just around yellow-faced cartoon with various expressions

1.The memoji is solely based on a human face, but an emoji can be any object, place, or even a symbol. While you can mostly craft a custom emoji personalized to your style and likings, emojis are limited. Custom memoji can also be dressed and decorated to serve as the perfect mini-version of you, complete from earrings to freckles.

2.Moreover, almost everyone has the same set of emojis. But since memojis are created to look like a person, everyone has a very unique pack of memojis looking like the cartoon version of them.

Despite the differences, both memojis and emojis carry equal significance and can spice up your texting experience in hilarious ways.
