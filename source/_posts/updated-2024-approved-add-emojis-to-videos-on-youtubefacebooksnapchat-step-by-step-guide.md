![make slideshow in iMovie ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-import-slideshow-photos-videos.jpg)

#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

 The Distracted Boyfriend meme is the embodiment of the awkward situation we find ourselves in when we want something other than what we already have. The original image was taken by Antonio Guillem and posted on iStock with a caption "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl". By early 2017, a few years after it was posted on iStock, the picture surfaced on social media, and it became a viral meme in a few short months. One of the first Distracted Boyfriend memes that featured a joke about staring at the sun during a solar eclipse was posted on Reddit and within 24 hours it gained 31.200 points.
