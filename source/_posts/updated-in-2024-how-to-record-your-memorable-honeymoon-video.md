If you ever wondered **how to use emojis on Windows**, or since when the emojis are around and what is their significance, you will find all your answers here. Because Windows 10 offers a great range of emojis that help you express your feelings and reactions in fewer words, they have recently gained a decent level of popularity, mostly amongst youngsters and millennials.

With that said, in the following sections, you will learn **how to use emojis on Windows 10** using both keyboard shortcuts and touch keyboard, **how to get emojis on Windows 10** to make your text or conversation look more versatile, and what new has been added to the latest operating system released by Microsoft, i.e., Windows 11.

#### In this article

01 [Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows](#part1)

02 [Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts](#part2)

03 [Part 3: How to Use Emojis on Windows PC with Touch Keyboard](#part3)

04 [Part 4: What’s New in Emojis in Windows 11](#part4)

05 [Part 5: How to Get More Emojis in Windows 11](#part5)

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

![use emojis on windows shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-emojis-on-windows-shortcuts.jpg)

Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.

As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:

**:** (colon) + **)** (right brace) will create a smiley face

**:** (colon) + **(** (left brace) will create a sad face

**:** (colon) + **;** (semicolon) will create a wink face

…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:

**Link:** <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/emoticon-keyboard-shortcuts-5dbe678c-cef7-4a63-aa62-f07c2f38b267>

## Part 3: How to Use Emojis on Windows PC with Touch Keyboard

If you have Microsoft Surface or any other device that has Windows 10 or Windows 11 installed on it, and can accept inputs via touch keyboard, you can enable the feature in the operating system, and then use the touch keyboard to add emojis to your conversion or content. You can follow the instructions given below to enable touch keyboard, and then learn **how to use emojis on Windows** 11 or Windows 10 via touch:

* Right-click anywhere on the taskbar (Windows 11 is used here for demonstration), and then click **Taskbar settings**

![windows taskbar settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-taskbar-settings-option.jpg)

* From the right area of the **Settings** window that opens next, scroll down to the **Taskbar corner icons** section, and then turn on the **Touch keyboard** switch

## Part 4: What’s New in Emojis in Windows 11

In addition to learning **how to use emojis on Windows 10**, it is also important to know what’s new with them or the emojis panel in Windows 11, the latest operating system released by Microsoft this year, i.e., 2021.

In Windows 11, although you can launch the emojis keyboard using the same shortcuts, i.e., ‘Windows + .’ or ‘Windows + ;’ keys as mentioned earlier, the emojis keyboard itself has four sections, namely:

* **Emojis** – Contains various emojis and smileys
* **GIF** – Gives you access to various animated GIFs from Tenor
* **Kamojis** – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(
* **Symbols** – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.

In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.

## Part 5: How to Get More Emojis in Windows 11

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

![use emojis on windows shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-emojis-on-windows-shortcuts.jpg)

Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.

As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:

**:** (colon) + **)** (right brace) will create a smiley face

**:** (colon) + **(** (left brace) will create a sad face

**:** (colon) + **;** (semicolon) will create a wink face

…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:

You can access the emoji menu for all Discord platforms by pressing the grey smiley face next to the message box. This will be on the right of the box for desktops, and for mobile apps, it will be on the left.

Discord-exclusive and standard emoji are present in the emoji menu, along with a part that keeps track of your most-used emoji.

On the other hand, you can also add custom emoticons to your Discord server if you have permission to do so.

Once you add and access the emoji on your device, select the one you want to send to your friends and press enter to send.

## Part 2: How to Add Emojis To Discord Channel Name Or Nickname?

* Select the emoji "browser" column and copy it either with the mouse or "Ctrl + C" on the keyboard.
* Access your Discord server, right-click the channel where the emoji will be and use the dropdown menu to select the "Edit Channel."

Follow the steps below for either platform:

* Access your Discord server to begin and press the arrow pointing down in the channel list with the server name—Press "Server Settings" in the menu

![Discord Server Settings Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-settings.jpg)

* As the server's settings open, you can add custom emojis in the "Emoji" tab. You can find a requirements list at the top that includes emoji names with a minimum of two characters and a file size limit of 256 KB. You can add fifty normal and an additional fifty animated emoji GIFs using the standard servers

![Upload emoji to Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-emoji-discord.jpg)

* Select "Upload Emoji" to insert a custom emoji, either standard or animated
* With the help of your device's local storage, upload the file. However, for the emoji to be added to the lists, the file should align with Discord's requirements.

![Uploaded emoji on Discord](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uploaded-emoji-on-discord.jpg)

* For every emoji image that you upload, an alias tag will be created for that custom emoji using the file's name. This tag is used to update a message with an emoji.
* A default alias name like this can be replaced by selecting the "Alias" box with the custom emoji and then creating a new name.
* Enjoy your emoji in chats as soon as you upload them to the Discord server!

How cool is it that you can add custom emoji to your smartphone as well? Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, you can use the same menu as Windows and Mac to upload emoji.

Discord's interface is similar across all devices, so the following steps work on Android and Apple.

* Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.

Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

![celaction2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/AdviceAnimals.JPG)

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

![memeeconomy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MemeEconomy.JPG)

### 3. /r/ComedyCemetery

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

You won't find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.

![comedycemetery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ComedyCemetery-meme.JPG)

The /r/memes/ is the funniest subreddits that use phrases to show the user's emotion, physical and mental state through the linked video or image. It has 1.7million subscribers.

The caption says he stole the camera from the paparazzi and ran away.

![memes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memes.JPG)

### 5. /r/dankmemes

The funniest subreddits /r/dankmemes/ are the sarcastic expressions describing the viral media jokes that have lost their comedic value or the intentionally inexplicable cliché. For example, a 7 year old boy asks, "what's virgin?" and a 9yrs old boy reverts, "allow us to introduce ourselves."

![dankmemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dankmemes.JPG)

### 6. /r/PrequelMemes

With 715k subscribers, /r/PrequelMemes deals usually with the star war memes. The photoshop memes or image macros series related to Star War films content is all about r/PrequelMemes. It helps to change the audience's opinion about the movie.

For instance, when the star war movie is about to start at 7.45 and at 7.40 you reach and your dad is still left to carry your baby brother from his car seat. You see a character from the movie asking you to leave him or else you cannot make it in time for the movie.

![prequeimemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PrequelMemes.JPG)

### 7. /r/terriblefacebookmemes

/r/terriblefacebookmemes is one of the funniest subreddits as it is a mixture of terribly shitty memes with various suggestions of granny-types.

For instance, a long-haired dead man was found standing behind a man working on the computer and his camera captured the image. It is thought to be a cursed image and if not liked and shared, it can bring ill-fate to you, or the dead person will be in your room at night.

![pewdiepiesubmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PewdiepieSubmissions.JPG)

### 9. /r/funny

It is the largest humor stock collection with about a 20.8million subscribers. For example, a badge with the Apple logo says, "Does more. Cost less. It's that simple. Apple." According to the meme, Apple has changed direction as APPLE product costs a bomb in recent times.

![funny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funny.JPG)

Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

### 3. /r/ComedyCemetery

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

You won't find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.

### 4. /r/memes

The /r/memes/ is the funniest subreddits that use phrases to show the user's emotion, physical and mental state through the linked video or image. It has 1.7million subscribers. The statements used are often ironical on the image or videos. For instance, a meme shows Keanu Reeves running with a camera and a man trying to catch him. The caption says he stole the camera from the paparazzi and ran away.

### 5. /r/dankmemes

The funniest subreddits /r/dankmemes/ are the sarcastic expressions describing the viral media jokes that have lost their comedic value or the intentionally inexplicable cliché. For example, a 7 year old boy asks, "what's virgin?" and a 9yrs old boy reverts, "allow us to introduce ourselves."

![dankmemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dankmemes.JPG)

### 6. /r/PrequelMemes

With 715k subscribers, /r/PrequelMemes deals usually with the star war memes. The photoshop memes or image macros series related to Star War films content is all about r/PrequelMemes. It helps to change the audience's opinion about the movie.

For instance, when the star war movie is about to start at 7.45 and at 7.40 you reach and your dad is still left to carry your baby brother from his car seat. You see a character from the movie asking you to leave him or else you cannot make it in time for the movie.

![prequeimemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PrequelMemes.JPG)

### 7. /r/terriblefacebookmemes

/r/terriblefacebookmemes is one of the funniest subreddits as it is a mixture of terribly shitty memes with various suggestions of granny-types. With around 216k subscribers, /r/terriblefacebookmemes is funny yet, relates to some old-fashioned ideas. For instance, a man thinking if the sun is said to be in space, why space doesn't have light and the earth instead has it?
