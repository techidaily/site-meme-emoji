 Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can.

## How to make the baby’s first year video

**Filming tips**

 Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

**Editing tips**

 Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end.

If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

### 1. Emojipedia

<https://emojipedia.org/>

![emojipedia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojipedia.jpg)

Emojipedia is an online library that holds several emojis. All the emojis that the portal has are placed in their corresponding categories.

Another section on the landing page of the website contains some of the most popular emojis, i.e. those that are mostly used by the texters during their conversions. Furthermore, the name of the emoji is present right next to it, and the entire part is hyperlinked which when clicked, takes you to a new page that has all the details about the object including its meaning, alternate names, and a button to copy the emoji to the clip board. The copied element can then be pasted in the text input field of a compatible messenger such as Facebook.

### 2. EMOJI DICTIONARY

<https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/>

![Emoji dictionary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis-dictionary.jpg)

**EMOJI DICTIONARY** is another online portal that contains almost all the commonly used emojis. The upper section of the page is dedicated to ‘Featured Terms’ with a slider that has all the featured emojis. The next segment lists all the categories other than emojis.

The bottom area of the landing page has all the emojis along with their names and/or the supported devices. All the names in the section are hyperlinked that open a new page when clicked, and show all the details such as examples, usage, and origin related to that particular emoji.

If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2123734/7443" target="_top" id="2123734">

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

### 1. Emojipedia

Furthermore, the name of the emoji is present right next to it, and the entire part is hyperlinked which when clicked, takes you to a new page that has all the details about the object including its meaning, alternate names, and a button to copy the emoji to the clip board. The copied element can then be pasted in the text input field of a compatible messenger such as Facebook.

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

#### 5. Add Titles and Text

Using some opener titles and credits at the beginning and ending part of your slideshow will make it cool as well. You can add some famous quotes and words to better demonstrate.

Just to the Titles tab and select one of the title templates and drop it to the timeline first and then write your own words in the preview window.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### 2. Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files

Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.

#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

#### 5. Add Titles and Text

Using some opener titles and credits at the beginning and ending part of your slideshow will make it cool as well. You can add some famous quotes and words to better demonstrate.

Just to the Titles tab and select one of the title templates and drop it to the timeline first and then write your own words in the preview window.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-title-templates.jpg)

#### 6. Add Music to Slideshow

You can download some royalty-free music and sound effects from websites such as [Filmstock stock media library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or iTunes or import your own audio as we said before to use it as the slideshow background music. To sync with the slideshow, you may need to trim and edit the audio accordingly.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

#### 6. Add Music to Slideshow

You can download some royalty-free music and sound effects from websites such as [Filmstock stock media library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or iTunes or import your own audio as we said before to use it as the slideshow background music. To sync with the slideshow, you may need to trim and edit the audio accordingly. For detailed information about iMovie audio editing, you can check [how to add background music to iMovie.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7. Export and Share Your Slideshow video

Play the slideshow and check the result in the preview window. If everything goes well, you can now export and share or save it. You can save the slideshow video in MP4 format, or share it to Vimeo or add the slideshow to Theater to load it on your other Apple devices so you can easily watch it on your iOS devices or Apple TV.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

#### Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library

iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either "File/Import" or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/add-backgound-music-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 3. Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video

iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It's a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

### 2\. Tubi TV

Tubi TV is a top-notch SolarMovie alternative site. With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more.

All the movie titles contain a rating that helps the user decide whether that movie is worth their time or not.

SolarMovie is an online video streaming site that offers a huge collection of movies and TV series. All these movies and shows can be streamed for free on SolarMovie. Furthermore, there is no registration required. Better yet, users can even download the movies in high quality.

However, some ISP’s have banned the SolarMovie website, and it might be inaccessible now. So, people are now on the lookout for a SolarMovie alternative that they can use to easily watch movie online.

To help with that, we have carefully curated a list of some of the top sites like SolarMovie.

### 1\. Popcornflix

One of the best SolarMovie alternative sites includes Popcornflix. It is a free HD streaming site through which users can watch movie online without having to register or subscribe. The range of movies available on this SolarMovie alternative is very extensive. Moreover, the movies are categorized as New Arrivals, Horror, Drama, Asian Action, to name a few. The categorization allows easy browsing and searching for the perfect movie.

### 2\. Tubi TV

Tubi TV is a top-notch SolarMovie alternative site. With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more. By selecting a title from the genre category like horror, lifestyle, or even stand-up comedy, users can easily find and watch movie online. This site might even be better than SolarMovie, as it has options to customize the resolution and the choice to display subtitles. An option of Add To My Playlist further makes this SolarMovie alternative an excellent site.

![tubi tv watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-tubi-tv-movie.jpg)

### 3\. Freeform

Among the sites like SolarMovie, Freeform also tops the list. However, Freeform is a cable channel that requires users to access the endless movie library through their cable provider. But, this SolarMovie alternative has a huge collection of the latest as well as vintage movies. On Freeform, you can watch movie online just by clicking and selecting your cable provider. You can sign up for free to resume your movie streaming from where you left off. Freeform’s movies are creatively classified as Fierce and Funny, Familiar Faves, and Throwback.

### 4\. Netflix

Netflix is an up-and-coming SolarMovie alternative that has dominated the online streaming sites owing to its vast movie library. Unlike SolarMovie, Netflix also produces many original movies that are available on the sites for HD streaming. Netflix, however, is not free. Users can watch movie online on Netflix by first registering for an account. After registering, users can sign in to watch movie online or download it in HD for offline streaming later. Furthermore, this SolarMovie alternative allows users to enjoy unlimited streaming on any device or platform.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 5\. Amazon Prime

Amazon Prime is yet another top-notch SolarMovie alternative. On this site, users can find an exclusive Amazon original movie collection. With an intuitive interface and easy browsing categories, Amazon Prime is the go-to site to watch movie online without any ads or any kind of hassle. The categorization is based on genre, awards, or audience, to name a few. Also, the movies can be added to a Watchlist for easy organization. But, to watch movie online on Amazon Prime, users are required to create an account and sign in. And unlike SolarMovie, Amazon Prime isn’t available for free streaming.

### 6\. Hulu

Like SolarMovie, Hulu also boasts an extensive movie library. This library by Hulu is a mix of popular and classic movies. Also, it features a variety of Hulu original series and movies that you cannot find elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a thriller or a documentary, Hulu has got you covered. However, Hulu requires a paid subscription. Before subscription, you can activate a 30-day trial to weigh whether Hulu is the best SolarMovie alternative and if it is worth your time.

### 7\. Yifymovies

Another amazing SolarMovie alternative is the Yifymovies site. This site rivals the SolarMovie website by featuring an up-to-date movie collection. What’s better, Yifymovies has classified its library into broad categories like adventure, animation, and documentary, etc. Users can also search by filtering out the movies on the basis of the year of release. All the movie titles contain a rating that helps the user decide whether that movie is worth their time or not. The video player in this SolarMovie alternative features the fast-forward and rewind option too. The only downside is that it has a few annoying pop-up ads.
