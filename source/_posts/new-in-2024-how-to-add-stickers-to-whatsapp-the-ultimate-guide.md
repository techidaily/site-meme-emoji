iPhone has now introduced a fun feature that lets you make an emoji of yourself, the exact mirror image of you, just smaller and animated.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### 2. Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files

Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-transitions-library.jpg)

#### 5. Add Titles and Text

Using some opener titles and credits at the beginning and ending part of your slideshow will make it cool as well. You can add some famous quotes and words to better demonstrate.

Just to the Titles tab and select one of the title templates and drop it to the timeline first and then write your own words in the preview window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
#### 6. Add Music to Slideshow

You can download some royalty-free music and sound effects from websites such as [Filmstock stock media library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or iTunes or import your own audio as we said before to use it as the slideshow background music. To sync with the slideshow, you may need to trim and edit the audio accordingly. For detailed information about iMovie audio editing, you can check [how to add background music to iMovie.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Filmstock-stock-media-library-banner.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7. Export and Share Your Slideshow video

Play the slideshow and check the result in the preview window. If everything goes well, you can now export and share or save it. You can save the slideshow video in MP4 format, or share it to Vimeo or add the slideshow to Theater to load it on your other Apple devices so you can easily watch it on your iOS devices or Apple TV.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

#### Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library

iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either "File/Import" or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/select-photos-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/add-backgound-music-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 3. Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video

iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It's a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

## Ways for iMovie Photo Slideshow with Music Making

To make a photo slideshow with music in iMovie, you can follow these steps.

#### 1. Create a New Project

After launching iMovie, click the Project button and then click Create New. Select Movie to combine photos, videos and music to make a slideshow.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-create-new-project.jpg)

#### 2. Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files

Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-import-slideshow-photos-videos.jpg)

#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-transitions-library.jpg)

#### 5. Add Titles and Text

Using some opener titles and credits at the beginning and ending part of your slideshow will make it cool as well. You can add some famous quotes and words to better demonstrate.

Just to the Titles tab and select one of the title templates and drop it to the timeline first and then write your own words in the preview window.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-title-templates.jpg)

#### 6. Add Music to Slideshow

You can download some royalty-free music and sound effects from websites such as [Filmstock stock media library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or iTunes or import your own audio as we said before to use it as the slideshow background music. To sync with the slideshow, you may need to trim and edit the audio accordingly. For detailed information about iMovie audio editing, you can check [how to add background music to iMovie.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Filmstock-stock-media-library-banner.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7. Export and Share Your Slideshow video

Play the slideshow and check the result in the preview window. If everything goes well, you can now export and share or save it. You can save the slideshow video in MP4 format, or share it to Vimeo or add the slideshow to Theater to load it on your other Apple devices so you can easily watch it on your iOS devices or Apple TV.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

#### Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library

iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either "File/Import" or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/select-photos-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/add-backgound-music-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 3. Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video

iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It's a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture.

In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

* [Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?](#part1)
* [Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: Create Memes with a Free Minion Meme Generator](#part3)

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.
