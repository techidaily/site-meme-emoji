Did you know there are 3,304 emojis as of now? Why do we even need emojis? Well, Emojis and emoticons have a long history within digital communication, internet culture, and digital content. Nowadays, emoticons have evolved into different animated versions like emoji, Bitmoji, Animoji, and Memoji. All these types of emoticons have become an important communication tool in the contemporary online world – especially on social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. If you are confused between emojis, Bitmojis, Animoji, and Memoji, read this guide to understand better!

Here is an introduction to emoji, bitmoji, Animoji, and memoji.

* [1.What Is Emoji?](#part1)
* [2.What is Animoji?](#part2)
* [3.What is Memoji?](#part3)
* [4.What is Bitmoji?](#part4)

#### 1.What Is Emoji?

Anybody with a smartphone should know what an emoji is. Open up your keypad, and the ideograms and smileys present there are called emojis.

![What Is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

We can say that emojis are an advanced form of emoticons, but instead of typographic expressions, they are in the form of pictures. In simple words, an emoji is a small digital icon or image that expresses your emotions or ideas.

Emojis are widely used in our day-to-day communications through electronic messages and web pages. The emojis on our mobile phones exist in various genres, including facial expressions, places, food items, types of weather, animals, and other everyday objects.

Over the years, the emoji lexicon has constantly evolved to become all-inclusive as emojis are for everyone. Nowadays, emojis can be used across cultures, across screens, and across time. Whether you are white or black, Muslim or Christian, or gay or transgender, there is an emoji representing you and your culture!

#### 2.What is Animoji?

Animojis are popular on iOS devices. Apple devices include an animated emoji feature that is called Animoji. Animoji is a 3D animated emoji that responds to your facial expressions. You can create and emojis on your phone using the front camera face ID system.

![what is animoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-animoji.jpg)

Animoji is created with the facial ID software allowing the screen to record and register your facial expressions and movements. The animojis recognize and copy your facial movements like pouting, lowering eyebrow, or rolling the eyeball.

Thus, Animoji is a customized or personalized animated emoji. Animojis have a range of expressions, and they also mimic to match the audio. The current full set of Animoji includes alien, bore, bear, cat, cow, dog, chicken, fox, dragon, rabbit, and many more!

Furthermore, Animojis can be shared as a video (with sound) via different messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

#### 3.What is Memoji?

Animojis evolve into Memojis. In simple words, Memojis are personalized Animojis. Such Animojis are 3D animated emojis that look exactly like you or an animated version of you.

![All About Memoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/all-about-memoji.jpg)

Memoji was first introduced by Apple, where the iPhone face ID camera system creates your avatar copying your facial expressions in real-time recording. Some high-end Android devices have also introduced the Memoji feature like the Samsung AR emoji.

The best thing about memojis is that you can completely customize them to suit you. From changing the shape of the head to brows, and hair color to eye color, you can make your Memoji look like you as much as possible.

Like other emojis, Memojis can also be shared on different popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.

#### 4.What is Bitmoji?

If you are an avid Snapchat user, then you must know what a Bitmoji is. Bitmojis are like Memojis, but they belong to the Bitmoji app owned by Bitstrips.

![What Is Bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-bitmoji.jpg)

Bitstrips is a company that makes personalized emojis and cartoon avatars. Snapchat acquired Bitstrips in 2007 and later on introduced it as a feature in the Snapchat app. Over the years, Snapchat released new versions, and now it supports Bitmojis. Thus, all Snapchat users can create their own personal emojis using the Bitmoji app.

Bitmojis are customizable to a great extent allowing you to create your own cartoon version. You can also choose from a massive library of different moods and expressions, featuring your avatar.

You can also share your little cartoon versions of Bitmojis on different social media accounts. Moreover, you can put them into any chat message or even status update!

### Conclusion

If it weren’t for emojis, the online messaging world would be so boring! Emojis add a touch of fun and emotion to everything. Therefore, the majority of us today use emojis to express our emotions through digital communication.

Thus, emojis have become the language of the digital era and social media apps. So, whether you use Emojis, Animojis, Memojis, or Bitmojis, they will lighten the mood and make any conversation fun!

Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.

First, let's check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

![what-is-memoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-memoji.jpg)

See best Memoji makers here: [Top 8 Memoji Makers to Make a Memoji on PC, Android, and iPhone.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

Read this article to learn more about Animoji: [The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

## List of iPhones and iPads that Support Animojis and Memojis

| Face ID                             | Animoji                             | Memoji                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| iPhone X                            | iPhone X                            | iPhone X (iOS 12 or later required) |

| iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) | iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) | iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) |
| iPad Pro 11-inch or above           | iPad Pro 11-inch                    | iPad Pro 11-inch                    |

Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.

**The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features**

Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.

#### Supermoji – The Emoji App

A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model.

First, let's check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.

**The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features**

Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.

#### Supermoji – The Emoji App

A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model.

Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model. Do you like using memoji and animoji animations to create karaoke videos you share with your friends on social media? Leave a comment below and share your opinions with us.

 It is no secret that we all lose our cool from time. It’s only natural, after all, the world can be a frustrating place. We’re all enraged by different things, some of us can’t stand pineapple on pizza while others explode when being pranked. What we often don’t realize is that being triggered in front of a camera makes us perfect meme material. Even though the majority of memes are still images, some of the [most memorable memes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created were [GIFs or short videos.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Making the triggered meme is easy when you know how, so in this article, we are going to show you how to make your next potentially viral meme, in just a few easy steps.

## The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme

 Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let's get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.

#### 1. A Triggered Template

 You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called [Triggered Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en%5FUS), that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.

#### 2. A Video Editing Software

 Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.

#### 3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme

 This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of [royalty free music and sounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint

 Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.

 Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.

## How to Make a Triggered Meme?

 Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.

#### 1. Adding Media to a Project

 Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.

#### 2. Using the Green Screen Effect

 Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.

#### 3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects

 In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.

 After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.

#### 4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme

 Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.

 Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.

#### 4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora

 When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.

 The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.

**Conclusion**

 The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends. What’s your favorite method of making memes?

Okay, let's get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.

#### 1. A Triggered Template

 You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called [Triggered Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en%5FUS), that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.

#### 2. A Video Editing Software

 Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.

#### 3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme

 This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of [royalty free music and sounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint

 Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.

 Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.

## How to Make a Triggered Meme?

 Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.

#### 1. Adding Media to a Project

 Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.

#### 2. Using the Green Screen Effect

 Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.

#### 3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects

 In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.

 After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.

#### 4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme

 Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.

 Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.

#### 4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora

 When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.

 The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.

**Conclusion**

 The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends. What’s your favorite method of making memes?
