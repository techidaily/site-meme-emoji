 The Distracted Boyfriend meme is the embodiment of the awkward situation we find ourselves in when we want something other than what we already have. The original image was taken by Antonio Guillem and posted on iStock with a caption "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl". By early 2017, a few years after it was posted on iStock, the picture surfaced on social media, and it became a viral meme in a few short months. One of the first Distracted Boyfriend memes that featured a joke about staring at the sun during a solar eclipse was posted on Reddit and within 24 hours it gained 31.200 points.

 The meme has since become synonymous with being unfaithful to girlfriends, ideologies, scientific evidence, photo cameras or virtually anything else. Despite its popularity, it is still difficult to make a good Distracted Boyfriend meme, so let's have a look at some of the best versions of the meme that emerged on social networks.

 The Distracted Girlfriend meme became popular soon after the Distracted Boyfriend meme went viral. The photo belongs to the same series of images posted to iStock by Antonio Guillem.

 The facial expression of the girl in the photo makes it perfect meme material because she looks as if she’s just about to risk it all and do what she wants.

How cool is it that you can add custom emoji to your smartphone as well? Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, you can use the same menu as Windows and Mac to upload emoji.

* Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.

![Discord Server Settings Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-discord-channel-settings.jpg)

* As the channel and server list opens for Discord, you can see a three-dot menu right next to the channel list with the server name. Tap on it to proceed.
* To get to your server settings, press "Settings" in the Discord server menu that shows up.
* Under the "Server Settings" menu, select "Emoji" to access the custom emoji settings.
* As the "Emoji" menu opens, you can see an emoji requirement list
* Press "Upload Emoji" to upload any emoji that aligns with these requirements
* Press the custom emoji file, tap "Crop" if it needs cropping, and then use the "Upload" option
* After you upload the emoji file, replace the alias tag by tapping on it. This will redirect you to that specific emoji's settings
* Type the name you want using the "Alias" box to create the tag used to insert emoji in messages
* Save this new tag with the "Save" icon placed in the bottom right
* Any changes you make to the custom emoji's alias are applied to it instantly for your use.

Emoji bring fun to the conversations you have with friends, and it is very easy to add them to your server as well. These show up in the emoji pop-up list once you add them. The chat message bar contains the emoji icon from where you can access them.

It is essential to name your emoji with only alphanumeric characters and underscores using at least two characters.

The Discord emoji size is 32x32 pixels, so even if you upload up to 128x128 pixel size emojis, they will be resized to the default dimensions. Furthermore, emoji file sizes are at most 256kb.

If you want to use custom emojis, you can't do so without a Nitro subscription because it is only functional on the server they are uploaded to. Even if you find a way to access the emoji from some other server, only its text code will be visible.

If you attempt to use the Emoji Picker to pick an emoji, you'll get the following message:

## Bonus: How to Manage Emoji in Discord Server?

You can't remove or add emoji specific to a server on your own as a member. You need the server owner to toggle the permission of Manager Emoji in your domain.

On the other hand, as a server owner, you can give others this role with the following steps.

* **Open Roles:** Open the Server Settings and select "Roles" from the menu on the side.
* **Toggle Manage Emoji:** Pick the role you want to apply the permission to, and then toggle emoji's slider to "on," save changes, and you're done!

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

SolarMovie is an online video streaming site that offers a huge collection of movies and TV series. All these movies and shows can be streamed for free on SolarMovie. Furthermore, there is no registration required. Better yet, users can even download the movies in high quality.

However, some ISP’s have banned the SolarMovie website, and it might be inaccessible now. So, people are now on the lookout for a SolarMovie alternative that they can use to easily watch movie online.

To help with that, we have carefully curated a list of some of the top sites like SolarMovie.

* [Best 10 SolarMovie Alternatives for You](#part11)
* [Bonus Tip- Make a Video with Wondershare Filmora Easy Movie Maker](#part12)

## Best 10 SolarMovie Alternatives for You

Even though there countless SolarMovie like websites on the internet, it can be pretty confusing to find the best one. Therefore, we have rounded up the top SolarMovie alternative sites for your ease.

* [1\. Popcornflix](#part1)
* [2\. Tubi TV](#part2)
* [3\. Freeform](#part3)
* [4\. Netflix](#part4)

* [6\. Hulu](#part6)
* [7\. Yifymovies](#part7)
* [8\. CONtv](#part8)
* [9\. Aha Video](#part9)
* [10\. Vumoo](#part10)

### 1\. Popcornflix

One of the best SolarMovie alternative sites includes Popcornflix. It is a free HD streaming site through which users can watch movie online without having to register or subscribe. The range of movies available on this SolarMovie alternative is very extensive. Moreover, the movies are categorized as New Arrivals, Horror, Drama, Asian Action, to name a few. The categorization allows easy browsing and searching for the perfect movie. This SolarMovie alternative boasts a category of Popcornflix original movies as well that are exclusively available on this site. A search bar option further eases the task of finding a particular movie.

![popcornflix watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-popcornflix-movie.jpg)

### 2\. Tubi TV

Tubi TV is a top-notch SolarMovie alternative site. With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more. By selecting a title from the genre category like horror, lifestyle, or even stand-up comedy, users can easily find and watch movie online. This site might even be better than SolarMovie, as it has options to customize the resolution and the choice to display subtitles. An option of Add To My Playlist further makes this SolarMovie alternative an excellent site.

![tubi tv watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-tubi-tv-movie.jpg)

### 3\. Freeform

Among the sites like SolarMovie, Freeform also tops the list. However, Freeform is a cable channel that requires users to access the endless movie library through their cable provider. But, this SolarMovie alternative has a huge collection of the latest as well as vintage movies. On Freeform, you can watch movie online just by clicking and selecting your cable provider. You can sign up for free to resume your movie streaming from where you left off. Freeform’s movies are creatively classified as Fierce and Funny, Familiar Faves, and Throwback.

![freeform movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-freeform-movie.jpg)

### 4\. Netflix

Netflix is an up-and-coming SolarMovie alternative that has dominated the online streaming sites owing to its vast movie library. Unlike SolarMovie, Netflix also produces many original movies that are available on the sites for HD streaming. Netflix, however, is not free. Users can watch movie online on Netflix by first registering for an account. After registering, users can sign in to watch movie online or download it in HD for offline streaming later. Furthermore, this SolarMovie alternative allows users to enjoy unlimited streaming on any device or platform.

![netflix watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-netflix-watch-movie.jpg)

### 5\. Amazon Prime

Amazon Prime is yet another top-notch SolarMovie alternative. On this site, users can find an exclusive Amazon original movie collection. With an intuitive interface and easy browsing categories, Amazon Prime is the go-to site to watch movie online without any ads or any kind of hassle. The categorization is based on genre, awards, or audience, to name a few. Also, the movies can be added to a Watchlist for easy organization. But, to watch movie online on Amazon Prime, users are required to create an account and sign in. And unlike SolarMovie, Amazon Prime isn’t available for free streaming.

![amazon prime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-amazon-prime-video.jpg)

### 6\. Hulu

Like SolarMovie, Hulu also boasts an extensive movie library. This library by Hulu is a mix of popular and classic movies. Also, it features a variety of Hulu original series and movies that you cannot find elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a thriller or a documentary, Hulu has got you covered. However, Hulu requires a paid subscription. Before subscription, you can activate a 30-day trial to weigh whether Hulu is the best SolarMovie alternative and if it is worth your time.

![hulu watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-hulu-watch-movie.jpg)

### 7\. Yifymovies

Another amazing SolarMovie alternative is the Yifymovies site. This site rivals the SolarMovie website by featuring an up-to-date movie collection. What’s better, Yifymovies has classified its library into broad categories like adventure, animation, and documentary, etc. Users can also search by filtering out the movies on the basis of the year of release. All the movie titles contain a rating that helps the user decide whether that movie is worth their time or not. The video player in this SolarMovie alternative features the fast-forward and rewind option too. The only downside is that it has a few annoying pop-up ads.

![yifymovies](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-yifymovies.jpg)

### 8\. CONtv

One of the best sites like SolarMovie includes CONtv. Although this SolarMovie-like site requires registration in order to watch movie online, the unique and up-to-date movie collection here makes it a very popular user’s choice. By signing up, users can also save their favorite movies to the watchlist. A premium account is available if users wish to stream and watch movie online without any annoying pop-ups and commercials. On this SolarMovie alternative, users can also have access to the latest anime series as well as classic movies.

![contv movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/8-contv-movie.jpg)

### 9\. Aha Video

Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

![celaction2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/AdviceAnimals.JPG)

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

![memeeconomy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MemeEconomy.JPG)

### 3. /r/ComedyCemetery

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

You won't find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.

![comedycemetery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ComedyCemetery-meme.JPG)

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.
