 Have you ever been so confused that you thought that a butterfly is a pigeon? Apparently, the main protagonist of _The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird_ from the Japanese anime TV series has. In an episode that was released in January 1991, Yutaro Katori seriously asked '_is this a pigeon_?' while looking at a butterfly. At first, everyone thought that it was just a poor translation, but it turned out that the translation was correct, which turned this still frame into a meme as early as 2011.

 After a while, the Is This a Pigeon meme came out of fashion, but at the beginning of 2018, it went viral again. Today the meme is used to express all sorts of confusing opinions, that range from popular culture references to philosophical questions. If you're utterly confused in certain situations or if you simply like making Is This a Pigeon meme, you're at the right place because in this article we're going to show you how you can generate these memes in a couple of simple steps.

## Part 1: How to Add Slack Emoji

At Slack, you can find a Slack emoji for every emotion or occasion. Finding the perfect Slack emoji is as easy as browsing through the categorized sections. Better yet, the option to search for a Slack emoji makes it a cakewalk to get the exact Slack emoji to express oneself.

Also, you can add Slack emoji with a single tap. And it allows you to add unlimited Slack emoji in one message.

Let me show you how to add Slack emoji in a few quick steps:

1.Download and open Slack on your desktop or smartphone.
