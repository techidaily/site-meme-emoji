iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

All these types of emoticons have become an important communication tool in the contemporary online world – especially on social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. If you are confused between emojis, Bitmojis, Animoji, and Memoji, read this guide to understand better!

#### 1.What Is Emoji?

Anybody with a smartphone should know what an emoji is. Open up your keypad, and the ideograms and smileys present there are called emojis.

![What Is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

We can say that emojis are an advanced form of emoticons, but instead of typographic expressions, they are in the form of pictures. In simple words, an emoji is a small digital icon or image that expresses your emotions or ideas.

Emojis are widely used in our day-to-day communications through electronic messages and web pages. The emojis on our mobile phones exist in various genres, including facial expressions, places, food items, types of weather, animals, and other everyday objects.

Over the years, the emoji lexicon has constantly evolved to become all-inclusive as emojis are for everyone. Nowadays, emojis can be used across cultures, across screens, and across time. Whether you are white or black, Muslim or Christian, or gay or transgender, there is an emoji representing you and your culture!

#### 2.What is Animoji?

Animojis are popular on iOS devices. Apple devices include an animated emoji feature that is called Animoji. Animoji is a 3D animated emoji that responds to your facial expressions. You can create and emojis on your phone using the front camera face ID system.

![what is animoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-animoji.jpg)

Animoji is created with the facial ID software allowing the screen to record and register your facial expressions and movements. The animojis recognize and copy your facial movements like pouting, lowering eyebrow, or rolling the eyeball.

Thus, Animoji is a customized or personalized animated emoji. Animojis have a range of expressions, and they also mimic to match the audio. The current full set of Animoji includes alien, bore, bear, cat, cow, dog, chicken, fox, dragon, rabbit, and many more!

Furthermore, Animojis can be shared as a video (with sound) via different messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

#### 3.What is Memoji?

Animojis evolve into Memojis. In simple words, Memojis are personalized Animojis. Such Animojis are 3D animated emojis that look exactly like you or an animated version of you.

![All About Memoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/all-about-memoji.jpg)

Memoji was first introduced by Apple, where the iPhone face ID camera system creates your avatar copying your facial expressions in real-time recording. Some high-end Android devices have also introduced the Memoji feature like the Samsung AR emoji.

The best thing about memojis is that you can completely customize them to suit you. From changing the shape of the head to brows, and hair color to eye color, you can make your Memoji look like you as much as possible.

Like other emojis, Memojis can also be shared on different popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.

#### 4.What is Bitmoji?

If you are an avid Snapchat user, then you must know what a Bitmoji is. Bitmojis are like Memojis, but they belong to the Bitmoji app owned by Bitstrips.

![What Is Bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-bitmoji.jpg)

Bitstrips is a company that makes personalized emojis and cartoon avatars. Snapchat acquired Bitstrips in 2007 and later on introduced it as a feature in the Snapchat app. Over the years, Snapchat released new versions, and now it supports Bitmojis. Thus, all Snapchat users can create their own personal emojis using the Bitmoji app.

Bitmojis are customizable to a great extent allowing you to create your own cartoon version. You can also choose from a massive library of different moods and expressions, featuring your avatar.

You can also share your little cartoon versions of Bitmojis on different social media accounts. Moreover, you can put them into any chat message or even status update!

### Conclusion

If it weren’t for emojis, the online messaging world would be so boring! Emojis add a touch of fun and emotion to everything. Therefore, the majority of us today use emojis to express our emotions through digital communication.

Thus, emojis have become the language of the digital era and social media apps. So, whether you use Emojis, Animojis, Memojis, or Bitmojis, they will lighten the mood and make any conversation fun!
