The first idea is sure to make the audience burst into laughter. For starters, one can swap their faces with animated emojis like an animated dancing emoji or a crying emoji. You can tell your audience what you are feeling right at the moment as you use those emojis and then show your real face.

### 2. Sharing a Story

## **Let's dive into the subject line!**

Stop motion animation could be a great idea while presenting a story that will take a short duration but carry a significant meaning. The meaning even you can portray easily with the animated objects, characters, figures, and the movement.

## Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?

While you are dealing with the digital creative aspect, you need to have a subject line, plan, execution components, camera and knowledge about running the camera to show its movements. In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Have you ever been so confused that you thought that a butterfly is a pigeon? Apparently, the main protagonist of _The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird_ from the Japanese anime TV series has. In an episode that was released in January 1991, Yutaro Katori seriously asked '_is this a pigeon_?' while looking at a butterfly. At first, everyone thought that it was just a poor translation, but it turned out that the translation was correct, which turned this still frame into a meme as early as 2011.

 After a while, the Is This a Pigeon meme came out of fashion, but at the beginning of 2018, it went viral again. Today the meme is used to express all sorts of confusing opinions, that range from popular culture references to philosophical questions. If you're utterly confused in certain situations or if you simply like making Is This a Pigeon meme, you're at the right place because in this article we're going to show you how you can generate these memes in a couple of simple steps.

## How to Make Is This a Pigeon Meme?

 There are hundreds of meme makers online, but some of them watermark your memes, require you to create an account or want to charge you for the service. That's why we recommend using Filmora Online Meme Maker that is free to use, produces watermark-free memes, and it doesn't require you to sign in. Here's how you can make a meme with this online meme maker:
