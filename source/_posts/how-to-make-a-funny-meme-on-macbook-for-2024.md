## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.

As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:

**:** (colon) + **)** (right brace) will create a smiley face

**:** (colon) + **(** (left brace) will create a sad face

**:** (colon) + **;** (semicolon) will create a wink face

…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

![use emojis on windows shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-emojis-on-windows-shortcuts.jpg)

Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.

As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:

**:** (colon) + **)** (right brace) will create a smiley face

**:** (colon) + **(** (left brace) will create a sad face

**:** (colon) + **;** (semicolon) will create a wink face

…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:

## Part 3: How to Use Emojis on Windows PC with Touch Keyboard

If you have Microsoft Surface or any other device that has Windows 10 or Windows 11 installed on it, and can accept inputs via touch keyboard, you can enable the feature in the operating system, and then use the touch keyboard to add emojis to your conversion or content. You can follow the instructions given below to enable touch keyboard, and then learn **how to use emojis on Windows** 11 or Windows 10 via touch:

* Right-click anywhere on the taskbar (Windows 11 is used here for demonstration), and then click **Taskbar settings**

## Part 4: What’s New in Emojis in Windows 11

In addition to learning **how to use emojis on Windows 10**, it is also important to know what’s new with them or the emojis panel in Windows 11, the latest operating system released by Microsoft this year, i.e., 2021.

In Windows 11, although you can launch the emojis keyboard using the same shortcuts, i.e., ‘Windows + .’ or ‘Windows + ;’ keys as mentioned earlier, the emojis keyboard itself has four sections, namely:

* **Emojis** – Contains various emojis and smileys
* **GIF** – Gives you access to various animated GIFs from Tenor
* **Kamojis** – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(
* **Symbols** – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.

In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.

## Part 5: How to Get More Emojis in Windows 11

If the built-in emoji library doesn’t contain your favorite expressions, you can always get several more by following the instructions given below:

* Launch your favorite web browser on Windows 11, and then go to <http://www.iemoji.com/>
* Click an emoji from the available options or copy one from your favorite portal, and paste it in the **Paste Emoji here** field

![select emoji from iemoji windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-emoji-from-iemoji-windows.jpg)

* Review the emoji in the **MESSAGE PREVIEW** field, and click **Create** from the **Options** section to generate the emoji that can be sent as a message or image

![create emojis on windows iemoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-emojis-on-windows-iemoji.jpg)

**Conclusion**

While the emojis were introduced to Windows as late as 2012, Windows 11 has a wide range of these virtual objects or faces for various occasions and to convey different expressions respectively. Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.

Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <http://www.iemoji.com/>, and using the options that the website offers. All in all, it’s easy to learn **how to use emojis on Windows** as long as you have access to the correct tutorial that explains the process in an easy manner.
