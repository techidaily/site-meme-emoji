 It is no secret that we all lose our cool from time. It’s only natural, after all, the world can be a frustrating place. We’re all enraged by different things, some of us can’t stand pineapple on pizza while others explode when being pranked. What we often don’t realize is that being triggered in front of a camera makes us perfect meme material. Even though the majority of memes are still images, some of the [most memorable memes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created were [GIFs or short videos.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme

 Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let's get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.

#### 1. A Triggered Template

 You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called [Triggered Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en%5FUS), that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.

#### 2. A Video Editing Software

 Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.

#### 3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme

 This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of [royalty free music and sounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint

 Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.

 Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.

## How to Make a Triggered Meme?

 Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.

#### 1. Adding Media to a Project

 Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.

#### 2. Using the Green Screen Effect

 Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.

#### 3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects

 In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.

 After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.

#### 4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme

 Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.

 Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.

#### 4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora

 When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.

 The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.

**Conclusion**

 The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly.

## The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme

 Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let's get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.

#### 1. A Triggered Template

 You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called [Triggered Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en%5FUS), that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.

#### 2. A Video Editing Software

 Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.

#### 3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme

 This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of [royalty free music and sounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint

 Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.

 Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.

## How to Make a Triggered Meme?

 Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.

#### 1. Adding Media to a Project

 Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.

#### 2. Using the Green Screen Effect

 Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.

#### 3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects

 In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.

 After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.

#### 4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme

 Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.

 Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.

#### 4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora

 When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.

 The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.

**Conclusion**

 The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends. What’s your favorite method of making memes?
