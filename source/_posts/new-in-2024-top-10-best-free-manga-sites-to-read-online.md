![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)

Gamers, YouTubers and all other Mac and PC users who’d like to add a smiley or any other emoji to a video should try processing their footage with the Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it. You can then adjust its duration, position on the screen or size. Optionally, you can double-click on the emoji to access the Motion tab that enables you to choose between different motion effects.

###### Export the Project

Preview the results by hitting the space button on your keyboard or clicking on the Play button that is located below the app’s preview window. In case you don’t want to make any more edits to the footage, you should click on the **Export button** and choose if you want to export your project to a hard drive on your computer or to your YouTube or Vimeo channel.

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from [Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You don’t have to spend any additional money on this pack that contains **24 different emojis**, but you must create an account on Filmstock before you can download the Animated Emoji Pack to your computer.

Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button. You can check our step guide about [How to add picture to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get more clues about that.

## How to Add Emojis and Stickers to Videos on an iPhone

![Add Emoji to Video in Apple Clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-sticker-emoji-apple-clip.jpg)

The Apple’s [Clip](https://itunes.apple.com/al/app/clips/id1212699939?mt=8) app that can be downloaded for free from the AppStore seems to be a perfect solution for all iPhone users who want to add emojis to their videos before sharing them on Facebook, Instagram or any other popular social media networks.

## Using Kapwing Meme Maker to Add Stickers and Emojis Online

![Add Emoji to Video in Kapwing Meme Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-to-video-kapwing.jpg)

Web-based video editing platforms like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) have been growing in popularity recently because they enable social media content creators to produce social media videos in a brief period of time. The Kapwing Meme Maker tool doesn’t feature any built-in stickers or emojis, so you must either upload a still image with a transparent ground to the platform or use its Text tool to add emojis to a video. Moreover, you won’t be able to animate the emojis you add to video clips with the Kapwing Meme Maker tool since the Kapwing platform doesn’t offer any animation tools. Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free. You should keep in mind that emojis can have different meanings in different cultures, which is the reason why you must make sure that the emoji you’re adding to your video isn’t inappropriate or offensive in the context in which you’re using it. It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free. You should keep in mind that emojis can have different meanings in different cultures, which is the reason why you must make sure that the emoji you’re adding to your video isn’t inappropriate or offensive in the context in which you’re using it. It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

Gamers, YouTubers and all other Mac and PC users who’d like to add a smiley or any other emoji to a video should try processing their footage with the Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

![use emojis on windows shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-emojis-on-windows-shortcuts.jpg)

Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.

As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:

**:** (colon) + **)** (right brace) will create a smiley face

**:** (colon) + **(** (left brace) will create a sad face

**:** (colon) + **;** (semicolon) will create a wink face

…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:

**Link:** <https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/emoticon-keyboard-shortcuts-5dbe678c-cef7-4a63-aa62-f07c2f38b267>

## Part 3: How to Use Emojis on Windows PC with Touch Keyboard

If you have Microsoft Surface or any other device that has Windows 10 or Windows 11 installed on it, and can accept inputs via touch keyboard, you can enable the feature in the operating system, and then use the touch keyboard to add emojis to your conversion or content. You can follow the instructions given below to enable touch keyboard, and then learn **how to use emojis on Windows** 11 or Windows 10 via touch:

* Right-click anywhere on the taskbar (Windows 11 is used here for demonstration), and then click **Taskbar settings**

![windows taskbar settings option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/windows-taskbar-settings-option.jpg)

In addition to learning **how to use emojis on Windows 10**, it is also important to know what’s new with them or the emojis panel in Windows 11, the latest operating system released by Microsoft this year, i.e., 2021.

In Windows 11, although you can launch the emojis keyboard using the same shortcuts, i.e., ‘Windows + .’ or ‘Windows + ;’ keys as mentioned earlier, the emojis keyboard itself has four sections, namely:

* **Emojis** – Contains various emojis and smileys

* **Kamojis** – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(
* **Symbols** – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.

In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.

## Part 5: How to Get More Emojis in Windows 11

## Bonus Tip—Memoji VS Emoji

Now you must be wondering what the difference between a memoji and emoji is. Well, there is the first major difference, which is that a memoji is the cartoon avatar of you, whereas an emoji is just around yellow-faced cartoon with various expressions

1.The memoji is solely based on a human face, but an emoji can be any object, place, or even a symbol. While you can mostly craft a custom emoji personalized to your style and likings, emojis are limited. Custom memoji can also be dressed and decorated to serve as the perfect mini-version of you, complete from earrings to freckles.

2.Moreover, almost everyone has the same set of emojis. But since memojis are created to look like a person, everyone has a very unique pack of memojis looking like the cartoon version of them.

Despite the differences, both memojis and emojis carry equal significance and can spice up your texting experience in hilarious ways.

## Part 1: How to Edit Memoji on iPhone

Majority of you might be iPhone users and so it's only fair to show you some easy ways on how to edit memoji on your iPhone. There are two ways to create a custom memoji and then edit it. Lets dive in!

The introduction of iOS13 has made it possible for the majority of iPhone users to create or edit their memojis as they like. But in order to use this built-in editor to create a custom memoji, make sure that your device is updated to iOS13.
