If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

### 1. Emojipedia

<https://emojipedia.org/>

![emojipedia](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojipedia.jpg)

Emojipedia is an online library that holds several emojis. All the emojis that the portal has are placed in their corresponding categories.

Another section on the landing page of the website contains some of the most popular emojis, i.e. those that are mostly used by the texters during their conversions. Furthermore, the name of the emoji is present right next to it, and the entire part is hyperlinked which when clicked, takes you to a new page that has all the details about the object including its meaning, alternate names, and a button to copy the emoji to the clip board. The copied element can then be pasted in the text input field of a compatible messenger such as Facebook.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

[Emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) have made it so much better for people to express themselves. Let’s say someone compliments you on a chat app; you can use a smiley emoji to tell that you are happy. At the same time, an angry emoji lets you express that you are angry.

Bitmoji is fun, but do you know how to add it to a keyboard? If you don’t, don’t worry, this post will help you understand how to do that.

04 [How to Install and Use Bitmoji on Windows and Mac?](#part4)

05 [Where can You Use Bitmoji?](#part5)

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

![create bitmoji mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bitmoji-mobile.jpg)

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

![create bitmoji mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bitmoji-mobile.jpg)

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

## Part 3: How to Get the Bitmoji Keyboard on Android?

Bitmoji is available for Android users as well. Before you begin to use it, go through the first part again and download the app. Then create your Bitmoji, as explained earlier. You can send Bitmojis directly from the app itself, but if you plan to use Bitmoji regularly, getting the Bitmoji keyboard makes sense. So, once you are done, follow the following steps to get the Bitmoji keyboard on Android.

**Step 1:** Launch the Bitmoji app. Click on the Keyboard option that you see at the bottom of the Bitmoji app screen.

![android phone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-phone-keyboard-option.jpg)

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

#### **1\. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit**

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.incomedia.eu/order/checkout.php?PRODS=14095146&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8b6cc3ee5ec407721ce3bf5ff4c0f56b/PRO_BUY_728x90-EN.jpg" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4530091&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/cit_win/banScrn.jpg" border="0">CollageIt Pro</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://aofit.pxf.io/c/5597632/1399701/16396" target="_top" id="1399701"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/16396-1399701" border="0" alt="" width="960" height="300"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://imp.pxf.io/i/5597632/1399701/16396" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Android.

![frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster.jpg)

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** **Studiobinder**

**Price:** $29/month (Indie); $49/month (Professional); $99/month (Studio) Free Trial is also available.

In addition, project management features such as task assignment and commenting help Studiobinder make collaboration easy.

Also, the platform includes a handy presentation mode so you can show your team your projects. The company boasts impressive clients such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and CBS Interactive. Team members who need to collaborate on various stages of the video production process and who prefer customizable tools should take advantage of this option.

#### **6\.** **Boords**

**Price**: $12-$24/month

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, and Mac

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.copernic.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=41033101&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://secure.2checkout.com/images/merchant/8d30aa96e72440759f74bd2306c1fa3d/Copernic-2023-Affiliate-728x90-Elite.png" border="0"></a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://shop.pcdj.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4698832&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"> <img src="https://secure.avangate.com/images/merchant/47f4b6321e9fd8e8f7326a6adc1a7c1e/products/karaoki-new-searchresultspane.jpg" border="0">PCDJ Karaoki is the complete professional karaoke software designed for KJs and karaoke venues.

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF.

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis. Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos

Even though recording thirty-second animoji and memoji videos with iPhone X, iPhone XS or iPad Pro is a quick and simple process, the time limit is still a huge obstacle to social media content creators who want to create animoji and memoji videos that surpass that limit. Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.

#### 1. Emoji Me Animated Faces

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.

#### 2. EMOJI Face Recorder

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545), Android

You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.

#### 3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes. The app lets you customize all of your facial features, and pick the shape of your nose, the color of your eyes or the accessories you want to add to the fictional character you’re creating. Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.

#### 4. Supermoji – The Emoji App

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

![what-is-emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

![what-is-emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

Above are the steps to make a photo collage using iPhoto on Mac/iPhone. We also list alternative methods to meet the different needs of the Photo library. So, if this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can also use some [online photo collage service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/) instead.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.
