## Mocking Sponge Bob Meme Generator

# Mocking Sponge Bob Meme Generator

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 The still frame taken from the episode titled 'Little Yellow Book' of the animated series SpongeBob SquarePants has gone viral a few years ago, and since then it has become one of the funniest memes used to mock all sorts of private and public issues. If you'd like to learn how to make the Mocking SpongeBob meme, you've come to the right place, because in this article we're going to show you how you can accomplish this using [Filmora Online Meme Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Making The Mocking SpongeBob Meme

_**Attention**: This post only provides the solutions to make memes for personal and non-commercial purpose. Since any redistribution without the approval of the copyright owners may violate the copyright laws, you'd better refer to the copyright laws in your country before doing so._

 There are hundreds of online meme generators you can use to quickly make a great joke or depict a situation you frequently find yourself in, but a large portion of these platforms watermark your memes, which can be frustrating at times. That's why we recommend using Filmora Online Meme Maker that lets you generate the mocking SpongeBob meme and all other types of memes for free. Here's how to make a mocking SpongeBob meme is just a few simple steps without having to register or create an account.

#### Step 1 – Uploading the SpongeBob Meme Template

 Filmora Meme Maker offers you 2 ways to upload images, videos, and gifs.

* Drop a file or click the + icon to upload your upload
* Enter the URL of your media file to upload

 You can find the sponge bobbmeme templates on a number of platforms, such as [Imgur](https://imgur.com/gallery/fJB0a) and [Know Your Meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/mocking-spongebob). Or you can click the “Copy the image” link below and the image link will be copied automatically.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/mocking-sponge-bob.png)

Copy the image

 Then, go to <https://filmora.wondershare.com/meme-maker/> insert the image link you just copied by press Ctrl+V, click on the Upload button to start the upload process and wait until the template is uploaded.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-by-entering-link.jpg)

 The Edit Your Image window will pop up on the screen if you decide to upload the template from a compute, so you can just drag one of the handles to crop it. If you want, you can rotate or flip the picture, before you hit the OK button.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/crop-sponge-bob-meme.jpg)

#### Step 2 – Adding Text to the Meme

 The Editing panel will appear on the screen, with the SpongeBob picture displayed in the middle of the screen. On the left side of the webpage, you'll be able to see the Text Inside and Text Outside tools that let you choose the position of the text in the picture. Select the **Outside Text** option because a great majority of Mocking SpongeBob memes doesn't feature text within the image. Below these tools you can find Top and Bottom text boxes, so you can just choose the position of the text and then insert it into appropriate boxes.
