### Conclusion-Ready to Emoji Yourself?

With texts being taken over by stickers and emojis, it’s high time for you to enter the league. Make an emoji of yourself in different moods and add funny backgrounds to express yourself fully and hilariously.

Use the in-built iPhone feature or a powerful app to make an emoji of yourself stand out from the crowd of mainstream messages. And take inspiration from our guide to surprise your friends with an emoji that looks exactly like you, just a bit smaller.

Here, we recommend [Wondershare Filmora](https://filmorago.onelink.me/4M4O/34b09bf4), due to its AR camera feature, which makes taking selfies more interesting. This AR camera function includes animoji and memoji avatars for a fun and excellent video.
