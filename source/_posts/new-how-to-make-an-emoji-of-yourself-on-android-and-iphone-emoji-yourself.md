We all love traveling and for a good reason. It allows us to relax, it removes the pressure from our life and it just makes the entire experience a lot better. But if you are a fan of taking picture while travelling, why not try to create a video slideshow with your images? This is one of the best and most original ways you can use it in order to share your travels with others. It works magically and it manages to bring in front some of those unique moments. However, you do need to have the proper tools when you want to create such a slideshow, but that’s great as we are here to help you with that.

## How can you create a travel slideshow with travel photos

**Things you need to know before creating it**

Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.

You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.

 **How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?**

Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.

Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

**Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.

Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

However, you do need to have the proper tools when you want to create such a slideshow, but that’s great as we are here to help you with that.

## How can you create a travel slideshow with travel photos

**Things you need to know before creating it**

Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.

You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.

 **How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?**

Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.

Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

**Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.

Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

![add transition to  travel photos video slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg)

**Step 5:** Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.

![export slideshow with travel photos](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg)

**Conclusion**

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

#### **1\. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit**

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)
<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://appsumo.8odi.net/c/5597632/2068416/7443" target="_top" id="2068416"><img src="//a.impactradius-go.com/display-ad/7443-2068416" border="0" alt="" width="1200" height="600"/></a><img height="0" width="0" src="https://appsumo.8odi.net/i/5597632/2068416/7443" style="position:absolute;visibility:hidden;" border="0" />
<!-- affiliate ads end -->

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Android.

![frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster.jpg)

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** **Studiobinder**

**Price:** $29/month (Indie); $49/month (Professional); $99/month (Studio) Free Trial is also available.

**Platform:** Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Visualizations can be personalized at every level in Studiobinder. Filters can be used to sort columns, order scenes, add images, adjust aspect ratios, color code images, and add notes to locations. In addition, project management features such as task assignment and commenting help Studiobinder make collaboration easy.

Also, the platform includes a handy presentation mode so you can show your team your projects. The company boasts impressive clients such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and CBS Interactive. Team members who need to collaborate on various stages of the video production process and who prefer customizable tools should take advantage of this option.

#### **6\.** **Boords**

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

#### **1\. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit**

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Android.

![frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster.jpg)

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** **Studiobinder**

**Price:** $29/month (Indie); $49/month (Professional); $99/month (Studio) Free Trial is also available.

**Platform:** Windows, Linux, and Mac.

Also, the platform includes a handy presentation mode so you can show your team your projects. The company boasts impressive clients such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and CBS Interactive. Team members who need to collaborate on various stages of the video production process and who prefer customizable tools should take advantage of this option.

#### **6\.** **Boords**

**Price**: $12-$24/month

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, and Mac

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

 The Distracted Boyfriend meme is the embodiment of the awkward situation we find ourselves in when we want something other than what we already have. The original image was taken by Antonio Guillem and posted on iStock with a caption "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl". By early 2017, a few years after it was posted on iStock, the picture surfaced on social media, and it became a viral meme in a few short months. One of the first Distracted Boyfriend memes that featured a joke about staring at the sun during a solar eclipse was posted on Reddit and within 24 hours it gained 31.200 points.

* [Bonus Tip-Memoji VS Emoji](#part1)
* [Part 1: How to Edit Memoji on iPhone](#part2)
* [Part 2: How to Edit Memoji on Android](#part3)

## Bonus Tip—Memoji VS Emoji

Now you must be wondering what the difference between a memoji and emoji is. Well, there is the first major difference, which is that a memoji is the cartoon avatar of you, whereas an emoji is just around yellow-faced cartoon with various expressions

## Bonus Tip—Memoji VS Emoji

Now you must be wondering what the difference between a memoji and emoji is. Well, there is the first major difference, which is that a memoji is the cartoon avatar of you, whereas an emoji is just around yellow-faced cartoon with various expressions

1.The memoji is solely based on a human face, but an emoji can be any object, place, or even a symbol. While you can mostly craft a custom emoji personalized to your style and likings, emojis are limited. Custom memoji can also be dressed and decorated to serve as the perfect mini-version of you, complete from earrings to freckles.

03 [Part 3: How to Use Emojis on Windows PC with Touch Keyboard](#part3)

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

### 1. Face Swap with Animated Emoji

The first idea is sure to make the audience burst into laughter. For starters, one can swap their faces with animated emojis like an animated dancing emoji or a crying emoji. You can tell your audience what you are feeling right at the moment as you use those emojis and then show your real face.

### 2. Sharing a Story

One can share a funny story with their audience by using the power of animated emojis. They can explain what happened with a series of steps and incorporate emojis in the background that sync with the emotional reaction of the user as well as the audience.

### 3. Dream Wedding Video

The next idea is related to a wedding video. To make it funnier, the user can first create a video of the dream wedding planned for them. Combine it with the actual wedding video and then use 3D animated emojis to express how everything was messed up and, in the end, and didn't go as planned.

### 4. Thoughts on Books and Netflix Series

The next idea is a workable and effective tool to make your video funnier. The content creator can make a video of a book he read or the Netflix series he watched and provide the audience with his thoughts. They can communicate the flaws of the movie or a book using animated sticker packs and gifs to make it funny and interesting.

### 5. Coworkers and Superiors Video

In this idea, the user can make a video showing his workplace and include all his superiors and coworkers. Afterward, he can edit the video by expressing himself what he actually feels about them and using different emojis to display the reaction of his coworkers in the video.

### 6. Video Techniques

The different video techniques can be used to make people laugh and be attracted to the video. For once, the user can quickly zoom in to the character when he is speaking to create a dramatic pull. In addition to this, one can also keep the camera on even after their dialogue delivery is concluded. This will capture an off-the-record reaction.
