## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
