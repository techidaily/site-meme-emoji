With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users.

In addition to learning **how to use emojis on Windows 10**, it is also important to know what’s new with them or the emojis panel in Windows 11, the latest operating system released by Microsoft this year, i.e., 2021.

In Windows 11, although you can launch the emojis keyboard using the same shortcuts, i.e., ‘Windows + .’ or ‘Windows + ;’ keys as mentioned earlier, the emojis keyboard itself has four sections, namely:

* **Emojis** – Contains various emojis and smileys
* **GIF** – Gives you access to various animated GIFs from Tenor
* **Kamojis** – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(
* **Symbols** – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.

In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.

## Part 5: How to Get More Emojis in Windows 11

If the built-in emoji library doesn’t contain your favorite expressions, you can always get several more by following the instructions given below:

* Launch your favorite web browser on Windows 11, and then go to <http://www.iemoji.com/>
* Click an emoji from the available options or copy one from your favorite portal, and paste it in the **Paste Emoji here** field

![select emoji from iemoji windows](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-emoji-from-iemoji-windows.jpg)

* Review the emoji in the **MESSAGE PREVIEW** field, and click **Create** from the **Options** section to generate the emoji that can be sent as a message or image

![create emojis on windows iemoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-emojis-on-windows-iemoji.jpg)

* Alternatively, click **Copy** from the **Options** section itself, and then go to the text editor or any other portal you want to use the emoji in, and press Ctrl + V to paste and insert the emoji in your conversation or text without any hassle.

![copy emojis on iemoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-emojis-on-iemoji.jpg)

**Conclusion**

While the emojis were introduced to Windows as late as 2012, Windows 11 has a wide range of these virtual objects or faces for various occasions and to convey different expressions respectively. Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.

Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <http://www.iemoji.com/>, and using the options that the website offers. All in all, it’s easy to learn **how to use emojis on Windows** as long as you have access to the correct tutorial that explains the process in an easy manner.

## Generating the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

# Generating the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

 Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we've all made more foolish assumptions than we'd care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they've become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the _Hood Documentary_ series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: '_You can't be broke if you don't check your bank account'_ went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.

 Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we're going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.

## A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

 Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you'd like to achieve.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-1.jpg)

_Can't lose_ _if you don't play_ is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don't try something you can't fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it's not, and that's the catch.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-2.jpg)

 A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren't in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you'll never be in a relationship.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-3.jpg)

 We all complain about financial troubles in one way or the other, and Roll Safe-Think About It offers a pretty funny way to do that. Once again, a seemingly valid point that only looks good in theory is the punch-line of the meme. There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.

Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button.

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it. You can then adjust its duration, position on the screen or size. Optionally, you can double-click on the emoji to access the Motion tab that enables you to choose between different motion effects.

###### Export the Project

Preview the results by hitting the space button on your keyboard or clicking on the Play button that is located below the app’s preview window. In case you don’t want to make any more edits to the footage, you should click on the **Export button** and choose if you want to export your project to a hard drive on your computer or to your YouTube or Vimeo channel. Select the output file format, click on the Export and wait for the rendering process to be completed.

With Filmora video editor, you can also add animated texts and titles to video, or apply various elements such as hand drawn, badges and elements for tutorial. Click to learn more details about [how to edit videos in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. Download Additional Animated Emojis from Filmostocks for Free

![Add Animated Emoji   from Filmstock to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-emoji-elements-from-Filmstock.jpg)

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from [Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You don’t have to spend any additional money on this pack that contains **24 different emojis**, but you must create an account on Filmstock before you can download the Animated Emoji Pack to your computer. The process of adding the emojis from this pack to videos is the same as the process of adding one of the emojis from the built-in Emojis category. Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button. You can check our step guide about [How to add picture to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get more clues about that.

The Apple’s [Clip](https://itunes.apple.com/al/app/clips/id1212699939?mt=8) app that can be downloaded for free from the AppStore seems to be a perfect solution for all iPhone users who want to add emojis to their videos before sharing them on Facebook, Instagram or any other popular social media networks.

## Using Kapwing Meme Maker to Add Stickers and Emojis Online

![Add Emoji to Video in Kapwing Meme Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-to-video-kapwing.jpg)

Web-based video editing platforms like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) have been growing in popularity recently because they enable social media content creators to produce social media videos in a brief period of time. The Kapwing Meme Maker tool doesn’t feature any built-in stickers or emojis, so you must either upload a still image with a transparent ground to the platform or use its Text tool to add emojis to a video. Moreover, you won’t be able to animate the emojis you add to video clips with the Kapwing Meme Maker tool since the Kapwing platform doesn’t offer any animation tools. Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free. You should keep in mind that emojis can have different meanings in different cultures, which is the reason why you must make sure that the emoji you’re adding to your video isn’t inappropriate or offensive in the context in which you’re using it. It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

![celaction2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/AdviceAnimals.JPG)

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

![memeeconomy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MemeEconomy.JPG)

### 3. /r/ComedyCemetery

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.
