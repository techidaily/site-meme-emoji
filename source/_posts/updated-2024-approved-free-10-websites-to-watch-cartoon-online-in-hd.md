Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

Price: Free

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Android.

![frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster.jpg)

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** **Studiobinder**

**Price:** $29/month (Indie); $49/month (Professional); $99/month (Studio) Free Trial is also available.

![studiobinder-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/studiobinder-poster.jpg)

Visualizations can be personalized at every level in Studiobinder. Filters can be used to sort columns, order scenes, add images, adjust aspect ratios, color code images, and add notes to locations. In addition, project management features such as task assignment and commenting help Studiobinder make collaboration easy.

Also, the platform includes a handy presentation mode so you can show your team your projects. The company boasts impressive clients such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and CBS Interactive. Team members who need to collaborate on various stages of the video production process and who prefer customizable tools should take advantage of this option.

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

<!-- affiliate ads begin -->
<a href="https://secure.2checkout.com/order/checkout.php?PRODS=4550420&QTY=1&AFFILIATE=108875&CART=1"><img src="https://www.pearlmountainsoft.com/n_img/product/pic/f_02.jpg" border="0">PearlMountain Image Converter</a>
<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

## Bonus Tip—Memoji VS Emoji

Now you must be wondering what the difference between a memoji and emoji is. Well, there is the first major difference, which is that a memoji is the cartoon avatar of you, whereas an emoji is just around yellow-faced cartoon with various expressions

1.The memoji is solely based on a human face, but an emoji can be any object, place, or even a symbol. While you can mostly craft a custom emoji personalized to your style and likings, emojis are limited. Custom memoji can also be dressed and decorated to serve as the perfect mini-version of you, complete from earrings to freckles.

2.Moreover, almost everyone has the same set of emojis. But since memojis are created to look like a person, everyone has a very unique pack of memojis looking like the cartoon version of them.

Despite the differences, both memojis and emojis carry equal significance and can spice up your texting experience in hilarious ways.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

### Alternative to Make a Short Video, Slideshow, or Photo Collage: Wondershare Filmora

If there are too many photos to save or share with friends and family, you can use these images to make short videos to better collage and share. Filmora can do this for you, through which you can easily crop, add effects, split the screen, and merge photos. In order to make the "photo video" lively and exciting, you can also add music, audio, animation, title, music, etc. to it.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

Above are the steps to make a photo collage using iPhoto on Mac/iPhone. We also list alternative methods to meet the different needs of the Photo library. So, if this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can also use some [online photo collage service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/) instead.

3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it.

Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button. You can check our step guide about [How to add picture to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get more clues about that.

Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free.

It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

The Kapwing Meme Maker tool doesn’t feature any built-in stickers or emojis, so you must either upload a still image with a transparent ground to the platform or use its Text tool to add emojis to a video. Moreover, you won’t be able to animate the emojis you add to video clips with the Kapwing Meme Maker tool since the Kapwing platform doesn’t offer any animation tools. Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free. You should keep in mind that emojis can have different meanings in different cultures, which is the reason why you must make sure that the emoji you’re adding to your video isn’t inappropriate or offensive in the context in which you’re using it. It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)

Gamers, YouTubers and all other Mac and PC users who’d like to add a smiley or any other emoji to a video should try processing their footage with the Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

You can then adjust its duration, position on the screen or size. Optionally, you can double-click on the emoji to access the Motion tab that enables you to choose between different motion effects.

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from [Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button. You can check our step guide about [How to add picture to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get more clues about that.

## Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos

Even though recording thirty-second animoji and memoji videos with iPhone X, iPhone XS or iPad Pro is a quick and simple process, the time limit is still a huge obstacle to social media content creators who want to create animoji and memoji videos that surpass that limit.

#### 1. Emoji Me Animated Faces

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis.

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices.

The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends.

However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.
