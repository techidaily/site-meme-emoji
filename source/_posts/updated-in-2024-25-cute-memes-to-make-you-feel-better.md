## How to Add Bitmoji to Keyboard? [Complete Guide]

[Emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) have made it so much better for people to express themselves. Let’s say someone compliments you on a chat app; you can use a smiley emoji to tell that you are happy. At the same time, an angry emoji lets you express that you are angry.

Apart from the generic emojis that you can find in your chat applications, Bitmoji enables you to customize your character and share it with people you chat with. Bitmoji is fun, but do you know how to add it to a keyboard? If you don’t, don’t worry, this post will help you understand how to do that.

05 [Where can You Use Bitmoji?](#part5)

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

![create bitmoji mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bitmoji-mobile.jpg)

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

![iphone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.

**Step 4:** You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.

![iphone keyboard bitmoji option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-bitmoji-option.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, toggle the option that says Allow Full Access. Once you do that, you will see a small pop-up. Click on the Allow option.

And that’s it. Bitmoji will be added to the iPhone keyboard. Open any messaging app and click on the globe and hold it for a few seconds. When you see Bitmoji, click on that, and you will be able to use Bitmoji stickers.

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

## Generating the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

# Generating the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we've all made more foolish assumptions than we'd care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they've become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the _Hood Documentary_ series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: '_You can't be broke if you don't check your bank account'_ went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.

 Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we're going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.

## A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

 Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you'd like to achieve.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-1.jpg)

_Can't lose_ _if you don't play_ is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don't try something you can't fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it's not, and that's the catch.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-2.jpg)

 A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren't in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you'll never be in a relationship.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-3.jpg)

 We all complain about financial troubles in one way or the other, and Roll Safe-Think About It offers a pretty funny way to do that. Once again, a seemingly valid point that only looks good in theory is the punch-line of the meme. There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.

## A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

 Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you'd like to achieve.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-1.jpg)

_Can't lose_ _if you don't play_ is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don't try something you can't fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it's not, and that's the catch.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-2.jpg)

 A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren't in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you'll never be in a relationship.

 We all complain about financial troubles in one way or the other, and Roll Safe-Think About It offers a pretty funny way to do that. Once again, a seemingly valid point that only looks good in theory is the punch-line of the meme. There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.

 Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we've all made more foolish assumptions than we'd care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they've become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the _Hood Documentary_ series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: '_You can't be broke if you don't check your bank account'_ went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.

 Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we're going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.

## Tips on creating a memorable honeymoon video

**Choosing the right camera**

There are many affordable [1080p or 4k cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you can use and all of them come with various features and prices. Obviously, you should try and focus on finding the right one that suits your needs. Take your time and study the prices and features then select the one you want based on your budget and expertise.

**Get lots of photos**

Another great tip is that you need to get as many photos as you can. No matter where you choose to go, there are tons of scenes, people, monuments and landmarks that you can choose to photograph.

If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

### 1. Emojipedia

Furthermore, the name of the emoji is present right next to it, and the entire part is hyperlinked which when clicked, takes you to a new page that has all the details about the object including its meaning, alternate names, and a button to copy the emoji to the clip board.

If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.
