 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Who doesn't like emoticons? They are fun, easy to use, and, best of all, highly expressive of your emotions that you cannot convey over messages otherwise.

A 2019 survey shows 70% of [mobile users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1068073/frequency-emoji-usage-mobile-phone-texts-social-media-mexico/) used emoji in texting or on social media daily. This shows the popularity of emoji in our world today.

Similarly, as a Discord user, you must have come across thousands of emoji in it. These are images uploaded on the server and called custom emojis that this gaming community can use for effective communication with friends and other players.

With the emoji and [gaming industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/) growing, it is safe to say that discord emoji's popularity and use will only increase.

Read ahead to see how you can add emojis on Discord if you want to have fun chats with your friends too.

* [**Part 2: Adding Emojis To Discord Channel Name Or Nickname?**](#part2)

## Part 1: How to Add and Send Emoji To Chat On Discord?

One of the best things about Discord's emoji feature is that there are two ways to add them. You can either access emoji on the Discord account or upload them yourself.

![Send emojis on Discord Chat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-emoji-discord-chat.jpg)

You can access the emoji menu for all Discord platforms by pressing the grey smiley face next to the message box. This will be on the right of the box for desktops, and for mobile apps, it will be on the left.

Discord-exclusive and standard emoji are present in the emoji menu, along with a part that keeps track of your most-used emoji.

On the other hand, you can also add custom emoticons to your Discord server if you have permission to do so.

Once you add and access the emoji on your device, select the one you want to send to your friends and press enter to send.

## Part 2: How to Add Emojis To Discord Channel Name Or Nickname?

![edit discord channel](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-channel-name.jpg)

As an owner of a Discord channel, it is easy for you to add emoji to Discord. Follow the steps below to figure out how to add emojis to Discord channels:

* Use the emoji list to find the one you want to use in your channel name.

Stop motion is the most adoring animated presentation of the social media era on digital presence. You can express conceptual-based ideas and thoughtful messages in a storytelling frame. We will discuss and get an overview of the stop motion ideas of kids and stop motion ideas for beginners in this article.

## **Let's dive into the subject line!**

Stop motion animation could be a great idea while presenting a story that will take a short duration but carry a significant meaning. The meaning even you can portray easily with the animated objects, characters, figures, and the movement.

Here, the movement of the illustrated figures and characters is vital because the camera uses in stop motion repeatedly getting on or off. Many frames are created to portray the story you want to present to your audience during the on and off.

* [Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?](#part1)
* [Part 2: 20 Best Stop Animation Ideas for Kids and Beginners](#part2)

## Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?

While you are dealing with the digital creative aspect, you need to have a subject line, plan, execution components, camera and knowledge about running the camera to show its movements. In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.

However, even for the beginner, the home could be the best option instead of a studio.

## Part 2: 20 Best Stop Animation Ideas for Kids and Beginners

We will see the 20 best stop animation ideas for kids and beginners for the next few paragraphs. We will divide the section into two segments: easy stop motion ideas for beginners and amazing stop motion ideas for kids. As kids are small and tender, we mention them in the first column and then beginners.

#### 1.Everyday Play Items

**For Kids**

Kids love to play with toys. But every day playing with the same toys brings boredom. Being a responsible parent, you must eradicate their boredom to teach him/them how to make stop motion with their daily playing toys. Place the toys over a table, fix the angle and place your mobile phone camera and start slow-moving and on and off the camera. It's fun for kids to create something different that can go online.

**For Beginners**

Take a basket, collect a few items from your daily use like pin, comb, paperweight, vegetable cutter, knife, stationery items on the table. You can adjust your home lights and set your mobile camera or DSLR on the tripod. Create something based on your thought process with the objects, start on or off the camera and make a little move to create the animation over the video.

The process is quite basic yet useful to know the camera angles, the lights, and shadow collaboration to create the magic.

#### 2.Lego stop motion

Lego is the legendary name in stop motion animation. The brick-style square figures or brickfilms your kid can create to lego stop motion. The creativity is unlimited, and your kid can express any story using lego animation.

Windows 10 with the latest version supports Lego animation. Your kid must know how to operate the Lego creation under your guidance.

**For beginners:** The best stop animation tries for the beginners, the Lego. You can create numerous characters, stories, and the message you want to convey through your animation creation. Lego is the best for beginners. You will get opportunities to experiment with the shadow and lights technique, animation movement tricks, and, if possible, voiceover gives you the perfect stop motion animation.

#### 3.Claymation

**For Kids**

You will get clay toys in every household and every kid's wardrobe. Every kid can prepare a figure out of those colorful clay bumps stored in their collection. If you hold the camera at an apt angle, place any clay figures and start camera roll on and off, a beautiful clip you can make.

**For Beginners**

You can make clay figures without hands or legs and make moves. Use a tripod and place it in front of those clay figures, put the lights on and start rolling the camera. The clays can depict a story without much of your efforts and involvement. The plus point of the claymation is you can use the same clay and make hundreds of stop motions and show the magic over the camera.

#### 4.Whiteboard stop motion for kids

If your kids are good at sketching or drawing, or painting, a whiteboard becomes a great idea to make stop motion. The shape and size of the whiteboard give you enough space to draw a story and show it to your audience.

**For beginners:** A small sketch by a marker on the whiteboard, use the white space, place the camera on the tripod and start to roll on. The major plus point to using a whiteboard is the spacious object and the sketch you draw over the board. You can easily brief the subject line, using figures, characters and make a super stop motion to feed your creativity.

#### 5.Sticky Notes stop motion for kids

You can create a sticky notes game or figures if you want to use the sticky notes board. Once you get the idea, you will never feel bored playing with sticky notes and create stop motion. But for the kids, it's high-level creativity that needs attention and support from your elders.

**For beginners:** The notes can be a great idea to draw a story or the game we used to play in our childhood. You can add voiceover or the music at the time of final editing. The movement of the notes with the rhythm and music create a perfect stop motion for your beginning journey.

#### 6.Paper-cut out stop motion idea for kids

The paper-cut-out stop motion is an interesting animation that easily grabs the watchers' attention. You can prepare figures and characters by cutting papers or directly cutting figures from magazines, newspapers, and books and creating stop motion animation.

**For the beginners:** It could be really fun to cut the figures from books, magazines, newspapers and make the story and give the animation form. Here it would help if you held the camera from the top of the object to avoid the shadow. The playful manner of shadow and light is a very important thing in paper-cut-out stop motion. The camera position would decide how beautiful your stop motion creation will be. Perfect practice for beginners at home.

#### 7.Floor motion or chalkboard motion for kids

The school classroom becomes our best play area if teachers are not around. Black or green boards become the best drawing space with white and colorful chalk. The same stance we can apply on the floor. You can draw figures and move on the floor and shoot. As a kid, you can take the help from your elder and create the motion of your choice.

**For the beginners:** For the beginners, the floor motion suits you best as you can use the space and set the camera and lights. You can draw the images and figures on the floor, place the camera as per the angle and start on and off. It is also a tricky stop motion idea for beginners to try at home to set the hands-on.

#### 8.Boing Claymation or Replacement for kids

Boing claymation intrigues laughter if you can add good sound effects. Though kids prefer the replacement stop motion, it is a funny animation if you manage to create. Lots of creativity and lesser arrangements are required to make this category stop motion animation.

**For the Beginners:** If you try your hands to make some funny animation based on objects available at home, Boing claymation is the best option to start working on it. The objects you set need to move from one place to another and shoot at from a distance.

#### 9.Human and shadow stop motion for kids

How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation.
