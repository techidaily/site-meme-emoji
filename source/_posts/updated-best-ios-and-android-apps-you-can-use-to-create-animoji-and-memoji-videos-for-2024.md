All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis. Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.

## Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos

Even though recording thirty-second animoji and memoji videos with iPhone X, iPhone XS or iPad Pro is a quick and simple process, the time limit is still a huge obstacle to social media content creators who want to create animoji and memoji videos that surpass that limit. Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.

#### 1. Emoji Me Animated Faces

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.

#### 2. EMOJI Face Recorder

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545), Android

You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.

#### 3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes. The app lets you customize all of your facial features, and pick the shape of your nose, the color of your eyes or the accessories you want to add to the fictional character you’re creating. Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.

#### 4. Supermoji – The Emoji App

![what-is-emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

![what-is-emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

**Conclusion**

Animoji and memoji videos have become one of the hottest trends on social media in a relatively short period of time. Looking like a panda or creating an animated version of yourself is no longer a complicated process since you can easily customize any character you want and share it with your friends online.

## Generating the Nut Button Meme

**Generating the Nut Button Meme**

The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word 'Nut' written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.

Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn't require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.

## A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme

Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won't necessarily make this meme as effective as you'd like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.

Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.

This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nut-button-sample-1.jpg)

The elements of the Nut meme are always the same, although their topics can vary because the hand and the blue button are irreplaceable parts of this meme.

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

![create bitmoji mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bitmoji-mobile.jpg)

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

## Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?

While you are dealing with the digital creative aspect, you need to have a subject line, plan, execution components, camera and knowledge about running the camera to show its movements. In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.

However, even for the beginner, the home could be the best option instead of a studio.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.

## Part 1: What are the Important Elements When Producing a Good Stop Motion Animation?

While you are dealing with the digital creative aspect, you need to have a subject line, plan, execution components, camera and knowledge about running the camera to show its movements. In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.

### **The significant elements are:**

* **A thoughtful subject line:** why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.
* **Proper planning:** It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.
* **Cameras and angles:** A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.

There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.

To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.

However, even for the beginner, the home could be the best option instead of a studio.

SolarMovie is an online video streaming site that offers a huge collection of movies and TV series. All these movies and shows can be streamed for free on SolarMovie. Furthermore, there is no registration required. Better yet, users can even download the movies in high quality.

However, some ISP’s have banned the SolarMovie website, and it might be inaccessible now. So, people are now on the lookout for a SolarMovie alternative that they can use to easily watch movie online.

To help with that, we have carefully curated a list of some of the top sites like SolarMovie.

Even though there countless SolarMovie like websites on the internet, it can be pretty confusing to find the best one. Therefore, we have rounded up the top SolarMovie alternative sites for your ease.

### 1\. Popcornflix

One of the best SolarMovie alternative sites includes Popcornflix. It is a free HD streaming site through which users can watch movie online without having to register or subscribe. The range of movies available on this SolarMovie alternative is very extensive. Moreover, the movies are categorized as New Arrivals, Horror, Drama, Asian Action, to name a few. The categorization allows easy browsing and searching for the perfect movie. This SolarMovie alternative boasts a category of Popcornflix original movies as well that are exclusively available on this site. A search bar option further eases the task of finding a particular movie.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 2\. Tubi TV

Tubi TV is a top-notch SolarMovie alternative site. With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more. By selecting a title from the genre category like horror, lifestyle, or even stand-up comedy, users can easily find and watch movie online. This site might even be better than SolarMovie, as it has options to customize the resolution and the choice to display subtitles. An option of Add To My Playlist further makes this SolarMovie alternative an excellent site.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 3\. Freeform

Among the sites like SolarMovie, Freeform also tops the list. However, Freeform is a cable channel that requires users to access the endless movie library through their cable provider. But, this SolarMovie alternative has a huge collection of the latest as well as vintage movies. On Freeform, you can watch movie online just by clicking and selecting your cable provider. You can sign up for free to resume your movie streaming from where you left off. Freeform’s movies are creatively classified as Fierce and Funny, Familiar Faves, and Throwback.

![freeform movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-freeform-movie.jpg)

### 4\. Netflix

Netflix is an up-and-coming SolarMovie alternative that has dominated the online streaming sites owing to its vast movie library. Unlike SolarMovie, Netflix also produces many original movies that are available on the sites for HD streaming. Netflix, however, is not free. Users can watch movie online on Netflix by first registering for an account. After registering, users can sign in to watch movie online or download it in HD for offline streaming later. Furthermore, this SolarMovie alternative allows users to enjoy unlimited streaming on any device or platform.

![netflix watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-netflix-watch-movie.jpg)

### 5\. Amazon Prime

Amazon Prime is yet another top-notch SolarMovie alternative. On this site, users can find an exclusive Amazon original movie collection. With an intuitive interface and easy browsing categories, Amazon Prime is the go-to site to watch movie online without any ads or any kind of hassle. The categorization is based on genre, awards, or audience, to name a few. Also, the movies can be added to a Watchlist for easy organization. But, to watch movie online on Amazon Prime, users are required to create an account and sign in. And unlike SolarMovie, Amazon Prime isn’t available for free streaming.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
![amazon prime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-amazon-prime-video.jpg)

### 6\. Hulu

Like SolarMovie, Hulu also boasts an extensive movie library. This library by Hulu is a mix of popular and classic movies. Also, it features a variety of Hulu original series and movies that you cannot find elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a thriller or a documentary, Hulu has got you covered. However, Hulu requires a paid subscription. Before subscription, you can activate a 30-day trial to weigh whether Hulu is the best SolarMovie alternative and if it is worth your time.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
### 7\. Yifymovies

Another amazing SolarMovie alternative is the Yifymovies site. This site rivals the SolarMovie website by featuring an up-to-date movie collection. What’s better, Yifymovies has classified its library into broad categories like adventure, animation, and documentary, etc. Users can also search by filtering out the movies on the basis of the year of release. All the movie titles contain a rating that helps the user decide whether that movie is worth their time or not. The video player in this SolarMovie alternative features the fast-forward and rewind option too. The only downside is that it has a few annoying pop-up ads.
