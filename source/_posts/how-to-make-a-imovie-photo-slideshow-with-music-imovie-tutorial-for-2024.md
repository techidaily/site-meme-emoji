#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

#### **1\. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit**

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Android.

![frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster.jpg)

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** **Studiobinder**

**Price:** $29/month (Indie); $49/month (Professional); $99/month (Studio) Free Trial is also available.

**Platform:** Windows, Linux, and Mac.

![studiobinder-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/studiobinder-poster.jpg)

Visualizations can be personalized at every level in Studiobinder. Filters can be used to sort columns, order scenes, add images, adjust aspect ratios, color code images, and add notes to locations. In addition, project management features such as task assignment and commenting help Studiobinder make collaboration easy.

Also, the platform includes a handy presentation mode so you can show your team your projects. The company boasts impressive clients such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and CBS Interactive. Team members who need to collaborate on various stages of the video production process and who prefer customizable tools should take advantage of this option.

#### **6\.** **Boords**

**Price**: $12-$24/month

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, and Mac

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Scripts from any program can be imported into the software.

#### **6\.** **Boords**

**Price**: $12-$24/month

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, and Mac

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors.

Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own).

Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

Did you know there are 3,304 emojis as of now? Why do we even need emojis? Well, Emojis and emoticons have a long history within digital communication, internet culture, and digital content. Nowadays, emoticons have evolved into different animated versions like emoji, Bitmoji, Animoji, and Memoji. All these types of emoticons have become an important communication tool in the contemporary online world – especially on social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. If you are confused between emojis, Bitmojis, Animoji, and Memoji, read this guide to understand better!

Here is an introduction to emoji, bitmoji, Animoji, and memoji.

* [1.What Is Emoji?](#part1)
* [2.What is Animoji?](#part2)
* [3.What is Memoji?](#part3)
* [4.What is Bitmoji?](#part4)

#### 1.What Is Emoji?

Anybody with a smartphone should know what an emoji is. Open up your keypad, and the ideograms and smileys present there are called emojis.

![What Is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

We can say that emojis are an advanced form of emoticons, but instead of typographic expressions, they are in the form of pictures. In simple words, an emoji is a small digital icon or image that expresses your emotions or ideas.

Emojis are widely used in our day-to-day communications through electronic messages and web pages. The emojis on our mobile phones exist in various genres, including facial expressions, places, food items, types of weather, animals, and other everyday objects.

Over the years, the emoji lexicon has constantly evolved to become all-inclusive as emojis are for everyone. Nowadays, emojis can be used across cultures, across screens, and across time. Whether you are white or black, Muslim or Christian, or gay or transgender, there is an emoji representing you and your culture!

#### 2.What is Animoji?

Animojis are popular on iOS devices. Apple devices include an animated emoji feature that is called Animoji. Animoji is a 3D animated emoji that responds to your facial expressions. You can create and emojis on your phone using the front camera face ID system.

![what is animoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-animoji.jpg)

Animoji is created with the facial ID software allowing the screen to record and register your facial expressions and movements. The animojis recognize and copy your facial movements like pouting, lowering eyebrow, or rolling the eyeball.

Thus, Animoji is a customized or personalized animated emoji. Animojis have a range of expressions, and they also mimic to match the audio. The current full set of Animoji includes alien, bore, bear, cat, cow, dog, chicken, fox, dragon, rabbit, and many more!

Furthermore, Animojis can be shared as a video (with sound) via different messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

#### 3.What is Memoji?

Animojis evolve into Memojis. In simple words, Memojis are personalized Animojis. Such Animojis are 3D animated emojis that look exactly like you or an animated version of you.

![All About Memoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/all-about-memoji.jpg)

Memoji was first introduced by Apple, where the iPhone face ID camera system creates your avatar copying your facial expressions in real-time recording. Some high-end Android devices have also introduced the Memoji feature like the Samsung AR emoji.

The best thing about memojis is that you can completely customize them to suit you. From changing the shape of the head to brows, and hair color to eye color, you can make your Memoji look like you as much as possible.

Like other emojis, Memojis can also be shared on different popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.

#### 4.What is Bitmoji?

If you are an avid Snapchat user, then you must know what a Bitmoji is. Bitmojis are like Memojis, but they belong to the Bitmoji app owned by Bitstrips.

![What Is Bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-bitmoji.jpg)

Bitstrips is a company that makes personalized emojis and cartoon avatars. Snapchat acquired Bitstrips in 2007 and later on introduced it as a feature in the Snapchat app. Over the years, Snapchat released new versions, and now it supports Bitmojis. Thus, all Snapchat users can create their own personal emojis using the Bitmoji app.

Bitmojis are customizable to a great extent allowing you to create your own cartoon version. You can also choose from a massive library of different moods and expressions, featuring your avatar.

You can also share your little cartoon versions of Bitmojis on different social media accounts. Moreover, you can put them into any chat message or even status update!

### Conclusion

If it weren’t for emojis, the online messaging world would be so boring! Emojis add a touch of fun and emotion to everything. Therefore, the majority of us today use emojis to express our emotions through digital communication.

Thus, emojis have become the language of the digital era and social media apps. So, whether you use Emojis, Animojis, Memojis, or Bitmojis, they will lighten the mood and make any conversation fun!

Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.

First, let's check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

![what-is-memoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-memoji.jpg)

See best Memoji makers here: [Top 8 Memoji Makers to Make a Memoji on PC, Android, and iPhone.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

Read this article to learn more about Animoji: [The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.

**The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features**

Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.

#### Supermoji – The Emoji App

A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model. Do you like using memoji and animoji animations to create karaoke videos you share with your friends on social media? Leave a comment below and share your opinions with us.

Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.

First, let's check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

Read this article to learn more about Animoji: [The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

## List of iPhones and iPads that Support Animojis and Memojis

| Face ID                             | Animoji                             | Memoji                              |
| ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| iPhone X                            | iPhone X                            | iPhone X (iOS 12 or later required) |
| iPhone XR                           | iPhone XR                           | iPhone XR                           |
| iPhone XS                           | iPhone XS                           | iPhone XS                           |
| iPhone XS Max                       | iPhone XS Max                       | iPhone XS Max                       |
| iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) | iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) | iPad Pro 12.9-inch (3rd generation) |
| iPad Pro 11-inch or above           | iPad Pro 11-inch                    | iPad Pro 11-inch                    |

Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.

**The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features**

Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.

#### Supermoji – The Emoji App

A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model. Do you like using memoji and animoji animations to create karaoke videos you share with your friends on social media? Leave a comment below and share your opinions with us.
