Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

![frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster.jpg)

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** **Studiobinder**

**Platform:** Windows, Linux, and Mac.

![studiobinder-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/studiobinder-poster.jpg)

Team members who need to collaborate on various stages of the video production process and who prefer customizable tools should take advantage of this option.

#### **6\.** **Boords**

**Price**: $12-$24/month

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, and Mac

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

#### **1\. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit**

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

## Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021

The delayed-release **"Minions: The Rise of Gru"** is no laughing concern, but there'll be miles into smiles with or top collection of minion memes that include all **funny minion memes**, **Facebook minion memes**, and more.

So, let’s dive into them without further ado!

### 1.Magnetos

We are all familiar with the “X-Men” installations/movies and the sometimes the supervillain and evil-doer Magneto, who is smart enough to control iron?

### 7.Chasing my dream

You know, when people act some fantastic stuff but mean something else, like when they say "would die" if they don't eat that Chicken kebab! Even though it uses the literal word, it does not mean they die over a chicken wing piece; they exaggerate.

![chasing dream minion meme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/chasing-dream-minion-meme.jpg)

### 8.A Vegan Zombie

Ever met a zombie that hates meat? The one who likes to eat earthworms, grass, and grubs? Have you encountered a zombie? Well, we haven’t.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

## Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021

The delayed-release **"Minions: The Rise of Gru"** is no laughing concern, but there'll be miles into smiles with or top collection of minion memes that include all **funny minion memes**, **Facebook minion memes**, and more.

So, let’s dive into them without further ado!

### 1.Magnetos

We are all familiar with the “X-Men” installations/movies and the sometimes the supervillain and evil-doer Magneto, who is smart enough to control iron?

You know, when people act some fantastic stuff but mean something else, like when they say "would die" if they don't eat that Chicken kebab! Even though it uses the literal word, it does not mean they die over a chicken wing piece; they exaggerate.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Makings a slideshow is a great way to share photos and videos with friends and families. The good news is that you can totally make a slideshow on Mac for free with iMovie. iMovie is the pre-installed program coming with every new Mac. It provides a simple yet professional way to make slideshow movies from your photos, videos, and music.

If you haven’t iMovie installed on your Mac yet, just go to iTunes and download it for free. In the following part, I’ll share with you the step-by-step tutorial on how to make a slideshow on Mac using the free video editing software iMovie.

If you are an iOS user, check our picks of [best photo slideshow apps](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) for iPhone or iPad.

## Ways for iMovie Photo Slideshow with Music Making

To make a photo slideshow with music in iMovie, you can follow these steps.

#### 1. Create a New Project

After launching iMovie, click the Project button and then click Create New. Select Movie to combine photos, videos and music to make a slideshow.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-create-new-project.jpg)

#### 2. Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files

Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-import-slideshow-photos-videos.jpg)

#### 3. Arrange Media in Timeline and Adjust

Now, it’s time to place all these photos and videos in the timeline in order and do some adjustments. You can use the Magic Wand tool to improve the photo quality automatically, do some color correction, or add a filter to the photo. If you preview the video clip, you will see more options that allow you to do more editing, such as changing speed.

#### 4. Apply Transitions & Effects

Transitions and effects will help you to create a slideshow in a more professional way. Some transitions such as cross dissolve, fade and cross blur are very popular in the slideshow, but remember don’t use lots of different transitions in one slideshow since too many transitions will distract the viewer’s attention. To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-transitions-library.jpg)

#### 5. Add Titles and Text

Using some opener titles and credits at the beginning and ending part of your slideshow will make it cool as well. You can add some famous quotes and words to better demonstrate.

Just to the Titles tab and select one of the title templates and drop it to the timeline first and then write your own words in the preview window.

![make slideshow in iMovie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/imovie-title-templates.jpg)

#### 6. Add Music to Slideshow

You can download some royalty-free music and sound effects from websites such as [Filmstock stock media library](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) or iTunes or import your own audio as we said before to use it as the slideshow background music. To sync with the slideshow, you may need to trim and edit the audio accordingly. For detailed information about iMovie audio editing, you can check [how to add background music to iMovie.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/Filmstock-stock-media-library-banner.jpg)](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

#### 7. Export and Share Your Slideshow video

Play the slideshow and check the result in the preview window. If everything goes well, you can now export and share or save it. You can save the slideshow video in MP4 format, or share it to Vimeo or add the slideshow to Theater to load it on your other Apple devices so you can easily watch it on your iOS devices or Apple TV.

I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.

If you're running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.

#### Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library

iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either "File/Import" or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.

After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or "double arrow" button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/select-photos-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project

Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.

So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.

However, iMovie doesn't support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.

![make imovie slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/topic/video-editing/add-backgound-music-to-imovie.jpg "make imovie slideshow")

#### Step 3. Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video

iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.

If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It's a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

#### 1 Import Photos & Video and Music for FLV Slideshow

 Install and launch the slideshow maker, go to **Organize** tab and import your photos, videos and music files. Transitions between adjacent slides will be used. But you can change them by following step 2.

#### 2 Apply Transition and Motion Effect

 This [slideshow maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/dvd-slideshow-builder-deluxe/download/) includes more than 100 transition effects for slides switch. Before applying, double-click transition thumbnail to preview in player on the right. You could also randomize transitions or apply one transition to all slides in FLV slideshow.

#### 3 Save Photo Slideshow to FLV Video

 Select Flash Video format as the output and make advanced settings by clicking Settings button. Finally, click Burn and wail a while, you get your FLV video to sharing on YouTube, Facebook, MySpace, Mobile Phone. Alternatively, play FLV video on computer via stand-alone FLV player.

### FLV Slideshow Tips

 For more detailed settings of FLV slideshow, click Settings button and specify various options, like encoder, resolution, frame rate, bit rate and audio settings.

 To play FLV slideshow on Nokia mobile phone, you should set encode type to Nokia FLV series (\*.flv). Once created, upload flv to Nokia phone or online and view FLV slideshow using FLV player or web browser plugin.

 You could also **upload FLV slideshow to YouTube** to share with more people. FLV videos are perfectly supported by YouTube.

#### More: Convert All Popular Formats to FLV

[Wondershare DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/dvd-slideshow-builder-deluxe/download/) supports all popular video formats. Therefore, you can import videos that need to change format, and save it in another format. It's not only a DVD slideshow maker, but only powerful FLV converter. For detailed supported input formats, check video format references.

#### More: Convert FLV to MP4, AVI, MOV, MPEG or Burn FLV to DVD

 You could also import FLV to DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe and save it as MP4, AVI, MOV and 3GP, or even burn FLV video to DVD with beautiful DVD menus. For detailed supported output formats, check video format references. Here, I recommended to **save FLV to MP4** for its comprehensive support on various devices, such as iPhone, iPod, Apple TV, Gphone, Nokia phone, LG phone, PSP, Palm, Zune, etc.

#### About FLV Video (Flash Video)

 Flash Video (\*.FLV) is a container file format used to deliver video over the internet using Adobe Flash Player versions 6-10 (developed by Macromedia). Flash Video content may also be embedded within SWF files. FLV videos are widely used by international companies, including YouTube, Google Video, Yahoo! Video, metacafe, Reuters.com, and many other news providers. Flash Video could be watched on most operating systems, via the Adobe Flash Player and web browser plugin, or desired third-party FLV Players.
