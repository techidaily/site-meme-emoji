We all love traveling and for a good reason. It allows us to relax, it removes the pressure from our life and it just makes the entire experience a lot better. But if you are a fan of taking picture while travelling, why not try to create a video slideshow with your images? This is one of the best and most original ways you can use it in order to share your travels with others. It works magically and it manages to bring in front some of those unique moments. However, you do need to have the proper tools when you want to create such a slideshow, but that’s great as we are here to help you with that.

## How can you create a travel slideshow with travel photos

**Things you need to know before creating it**

Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.

You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.

 **How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?**

Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.

Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

**Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.

Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

![Set up travel photo duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

![add transition to  travel photos video slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg)

**Step 5:** Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

We all love traveling and for a good reason. It allows us to relax, it removes the pressure from our life and it just makes the entire experience a lot better. But if you are a fan of taking picture while travelling, why not try to create a video slideshow with your images? This is one of the best and most original ways you can use it in order to share your travels with others. It works magically and it manages to bring in front some of those unique moments. However, you do need to have the proper tools when you want to create such a slideshow, but that’s great as we are here to help you with that.

## How can you create a travel slideshow with travel photos

**Things you need to know before creating it**

Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.

You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

![celaction2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/AdviceAnimals.JPG)

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

![memeeconomy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MemeEconomy.JPG)

### 3. /r/ComedyCemetery

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

You won't find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

#### **1\. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit**

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Android.

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** **Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** **FrameForge Storyboard Studio**

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Android.

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** **Studiobinder**

**Price:** $29/month (Indie); $49/month (Professional); $99/month (Studio) Free Trial is also available.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** **makeStoryboard**

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** **Canva**

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.** **PanelForge**

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

#### **10\.** **Adobe Photoshop**

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### **3\. Plot**

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.
