If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![ what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

### 1. Emojipedia

<https://emojipedia.org/>

![ emojipedia ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojipedia.jpg)

Furthermore, the name of the emoji is present right next to it, and the entire part is hyperlinked which when clicked, takes you to a new page that has all the details about the object including its meaning, alternate names, and a button to copy the emoji to the clip board. The copied element can then be pasted in the text input field of a compatible messenger such as Facebook.

This helps in locating your favorite elements easily and quickly. Furthermore, when you click an emoji, a new page opens up with all its definition from different aspects such as nouns, verbs, etc., along with a ‘Copy’ button that lets you copy the image to the clipboard, and use it on a compatible messaging app.

## Part 4: How to Find Emoji on Any Device?

Therefore, the following points explain how to find and use emojis on the computer running any of these operating systems:

#### How to Find Emojis on Windows 8 and Windows 10

On Windows 8 or Windows 10 computers, click the ‘Keyboard’ icon that is present in the ‘Notification area’ at the bottom-right corner of the screen, i.e. right side of the taskbar. When the list of emojis appears, you can click your favorite one and use it in the messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

### 1. Emojipedia

<https://emojipedia.org/>

![ emojipedia ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojipedia.jpg)

Emojipedia is an online library that holds several emojis. All the emojis that the portal has are placed in their corresponding categories.

Another section on the landing page of the website contains some of the most popular emojis, i.e. those that are mostly used by the texters during their conversions. Furthermore, the name of the emoji is present right next to it, and the entire part is hyperlinked which when clicked, takes you to a new page that has all the details about the object including its meaning, alternate names, and a button to copy the emoji to the clip board. The copied element can then be pasted in the text input field of a compatible messenger such as Facebook.

### 2. EMOJI DICTIONARY

<https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/>

![ Emoji dictionary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis-dictionary.jpg)

**EMOJI DICTIONARY** is another online portal that contains almost all the commonly used emojis. The upper section of the page is dedicated to ‘Featured Terms’ with a slider that has all the featured emojis. The next segment lists all the categories other than emojis.

The bottom area of the landing page has all the emojis along with their names and/or the supported devices. All the names in the section are hyperlinked that open a new page when clicked, and show all the details such as examples, usage, and origin related to that particular emoji.

### 3. Emoji Dictionary

<https://emojidictionary.emojifoundation.com/>

![ Emoji dictionary emojifoundation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis-dictionary-emojifoundation.jpg)

This one is unique in its own way as in along with listing the most popular emojis and their names and definitions, it also allows you to include your own information in case you know something other than what is already present.

In addition to displaying the top emojis right on the landing page, the portal also has a category list where each segment holds its corresponding objects. This helps in locating your favorite elements easily and quickly. Furthermore, when you click an emoji, a new page opens up with all its definition from different aspects such as nouns, verbs, etc., along with a ‘Copy’ button that lets you copy the image to the clipboard, and use it on a compatible messaging app.

### 4. EmojiMeanings

<https://www.emojimeanings.net/>

![emojimeanings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojimeanings.jpg)

The landing page of EmojiMeanings is populated with all the categories where each holds several relevant emojis, thus making it easier for the users to find and learn their meaning. The home page also has complete information about what emojis are, how they are different from emoticons, and what does the term ‘smiley’ actually mean.

When you click a category, a new page opens up with three major columns titled as ‘Emoji’, ‘Meaning’, and ‘Unicode’ that show an emoji itself, explain what it means, and what Unicode is used to form it respectively. All the emojis on EmojiMeanings are usually compatible with WhatsApp and Facebook.

### 5. HotEmoji

<https://hotemoji.com/emoji-meanings.html>

![ hotemoji Emoji  meaning](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hotemoji-emoji-meanings.jpg)

HotEmoji is yet another online portal that lists almost all the emojis along with their meanings. Each entry is hyperlinked which when clicked opens a new web page dedicated to that particular emoji where all the details about it are mentioned.

The new page also has a ‘Copy’ button that can be used to copy the object to the clipboard, and then the element can be pasted onto any compatible messenger during a text conversation.

## Part 4: How to Find Emoji on Any Device?

While locating and inserting emojis on any messaging app on your smartphone is fairly simple as the messenger already has an icon that opens the entire emoji library when tapped, things are a bit tricky while using a Mac or Windows PC. Therefore, the following points explain how to find and use emojis on the computer running any of these operating systems:

#### How to Find Emojis on Windows 8 and Windows 10

On Windows 8 or Windows 10 computers, click the ‘Keyboard’ icon that is present in the ‘Notification area’ at the bottom-right corner of the screen, i.e. right side of the taskbar. When the list of emojis appears, you can click your favorite one and use it in the messenger.

#### How to Find Emojis on macOS

While using a Mac computer, you can open the app you want to add an emoji to, and then press the **ctrl** \+ **cmd** \+ **spacebar** keys on the keyboard.

## Part 5: Most Common Emoji Categories

![ Emoji type: Smiley people](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smileys-people-emojis.jpg)

Some of the most commonly used categories that you must know after understanding **what is an emoji** include:

* **Smileys & People** – Holds the images of faces reflecting facial expressions and the vector images/animations of some popular people
* **Animals & Nature** – Contains the images/animations of animals and other natural elements such as trees, rocks, mountains, etc.
* **Food & Drink** – This category has vector images of beautifully decorated and well-aligned wine glasses, soft drink cans, pizza slices, etc.
* **Activity** – Has the emojis that reflect certain actions such as dance stances, walking, running, etc.
* **Travel & Places** – Is equipped with vectors of transportation mediums and locations such as trains, buses, buildings, banks, etc.
* **Objects** – Is populated with miscellaneous objects like a pair of shoes, suits, clocks, socks, etc.
* **Symbols** – This one consists of different types of symbols such as an equal to sign, stop sign, delta symbol, and many more
* **Flags** – This category contains flags of almost all the countries of the world. These emojis are mostly used to illustrate your current or destination location for reference

## Part 6: Tips of Using Emojis

It is always a good idea to use emojis every now and then. However, using too many of them in your conversation might make the entire text look overly populated, and your communication partner may lose interest in you. Therefore, understanding when and how to use emojis is as important as it is to know **what the emoji means.**

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

#### [**1\. Storyboarder by Wonder Unit**](https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/)

Price: Free

Platforms: Windows, Mac, and Linux.

![storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/storyboarder-by-wonder-unit-poster.jpg)

If you're on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It's free and open-source. In the program's clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.

The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.

#### **2\.** [**Toon Boom Storyboard Pro**](https://www.toonboom.com/products/storyboard-pro)

Price: $60/mo or $999 one-time fee

Platforms: Mac, Windows

![toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/toon-boom-storyboard-pro-poster.jpg)

Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it's also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you'd like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you're on target with your scenes.

The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.

#### [**3\. Plot**](https://theplot.io/)

Price: $10/month (14 days Free Trial Available)

Platforms: Windows, Linux, and Mac

![plot-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/plot-poster.jpg)

Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.

A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn't be easier.

In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you'll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you've still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.

#### **4\.** [**FrameForge Storyboard Studio**](https://www.frameforge.com/)

Price: $498.95 one-time fee or $12.99/month (Core Edition); $799 one-time fee or $24.99/month (Professional Edition)

![frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/frameforge-storyboard-studio-poster.jpg)

Even without animation, drawing, or highly technical computer skills, your team can benefit from FrameForge, with HBO, Netflix, and BBC as users.

There are two versions of FrameForge's product: Core and Professional. Professional offers planning capabilities (down to the inch) for dollies and cranes. Scripts from any program can be imported into the software. In addition to movement arrows, framing notes, angle of view, focal length, and more, the storyboards ensure that your video team understands all aspects of production, from preparation to post-production.

Mobile users can use it on any mobile device, and PowerPoint presentations can be downloaded as a final product. Team members who want to produce more elaborate and lengthy videos for entertainment purposes might find FrameForge useful.

#### **5\.** [**Studiobinder**](https://www.studiobinder.com/storyboard-creator/)

**Price:** $29/month (Indie); $49/month (Professional); $99/month (Studio) Free Trial is also available.

**Platform:** Windows, Linux, and Mac.

![studiobinder-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/studiobinder-poster.jpg)

Visualizations can be personalized at every level in Studiobinder. Filters can be used to sort columns, order scenes, add images, adjust aspect ratios, color code images, and add notes to locations. In addition, project management features such as task assignment and commenting help Studiobinder make collaboration easy.

Also, the platform includes a handy presentation mode so you can show your team your projects. The company boasts impressive clients such as BuzzFeed, ESPN, and CBS Interactive. Team members who need to collaborate on various stages of the video production process and who prefer customizable tools should take advantage of this option.

#### **6\.** [**Boords**](https://boords.com/)

**Price**: $12-$24/month

**Platforms:** Windows, Linux, and Mac

![boords-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/boords-poster.jpg)

In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.

The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.

For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.

Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it's right for you, but there is no commitment involved.

#### **7\.** [**makeStoryboard**](https://makestoryboard.com/)

**Price**: Free; $12/month (Professional); $36/month (Team)

**Platforms**: Windows, and Mac.

![makestoryboard-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/makestoryboard-poster.jpg)

MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.

Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you're ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method. The best part is that it has a free subscription plan, making it an excellent option for teams on a small budget.

#### **8\.** [**Canva**](http://www.canva.com)

Price: Free

Platforms: Works on all major Operating Systems

![canva-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/canva-poster.jpg)

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

#### **9.**[**PanelForge**](https://www.panel-forge.com/)

Price: Free (Public Beta); $7.31/month (Pro); $1,411/year (Studio)

Platforms: Works on all Major Operating Systems

![panelforge-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/panelforge-poster.jpg)

PanelForge delivers a feature-rich, drag-and-drop storyboarding solution with flexible frames and drag-and-drop tools. Storyboarding is free to try and offers a suite of paid plans for anyone working on animatics and more complex projects.

Drawings and 3D designs can both be created with PanelForge. Aside from creating animatics, you can also import and export files from Adobe Premiere and Final Cut Pro. The PanelForge tool is ideal for experienced marketers and storyboarders familiar with visualization tools.

#### **10\.** [**Adobe Photoshop**](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html?mv=affiliate&mv2=red)

Price: $9.99/mo

Platforms: Mac and Windows.

![adobe-photoshop-poster](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adobe-photoshop-poster.jpg)

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

#### **Conclusion**

So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021\. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.

It doesn't have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.

If you're working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you're done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.

I think it will stay around for a long time. It's been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn't it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there's even more support.

Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn't need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.

In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals.

Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.

You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.

No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you'll find the best options on this page.

You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process.

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

## Bonus Tip—Memoji VS Emoji

Now you must be wondering what the difference between a memoji and emoji is. Well, there is the first major difference, which is that a memoji is the cartoon avatar of you, whereas an emoji is just around yellow-faced cartoon with various expressions

1.The memoji is solely based on a human face, but an emoji can be any object, place, or even a symbol. While you can mostly craft a custom emoji personalized to your style and likings, emojis are limited. Custom memoji can also be dressed and decorated to serve as the perfect mini-version of you, complete from earrings to freckles.

2.Moreover, almost everyone has the same set of emojis. But since memojis are created to look like a person, everyone has a very unique pack of memojis looking like the cartoon version of them.

Despite the differences, both memojis and emojis carry equal significance and can spice up your texting experience in hilarious ways.

With the emoji and [gaming industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/) growing, it is safe to say that discord emoji's popularity and use will only increase.

Read ahead to see how you can add emojis on Discord if you want to have fun chats with your friends too.

## Part 1: How to Add and Send Emoji To Chat On Discord?

One of the best things about Discord's emoji feature is that there are two ways to add them. You can either access emoji on the Discord account or upload them yourself.

![Send emojis on Discord Chat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-emoji-discord-chat.jpg)

You can access the emoji menu for all Discord platforms by pressing the grey smiley face next to the message box. This will be on the right of the box for desktops, and for mobile apps, it will be on the left.

Discord-exclusive and standard emoji are present in the emoji menu, along with a part that keeps track of your most-used emoji.

On the other hand, you can also add custom emoticons to your Discord server if you have permission to do so.

Once you add and access the emoji on your device, select the one you want to send to your friends and press enter to send.

## Part 2: How to Add Emojis To Discord Channel Name Or Nickname?

![edit discord channel ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/edit-channel-name.jpg)

As an owner of a Discord channel, it is easy for you to add emoji to Discord. Follow the steps below to figure out how to add emojis to Discord channels:

* Use the emoji list to find the one you want to use in your channel name.
* Select the emoji "browser" column and copy it either with the mouse or "Ctrl + C" on the keyboard.
* Access your Discord server, right-click the channel where the emoji will be and use the dropdown menu to select the "Edit Channel."
* In the "Channel Name" box, past the selected emoji using "Ctrl + V" from the keyboard.
* Select "Save Changes" to save the name with the emoji.

## Part 3: How to Add Custom Emojis To Discord Server On Windows/Mac?

You can add custom emoji on Discord, but only if you are a server owner or administrator. Use the Discord server settings on either the desktop versions for Windows or Mac or the Discord Website.

Follow the steps below for either platform:

* Access your Discord server to begin and press the arrow pointing down in the channel list with the server name—Press "Server Settings" in the menu

![Discord Server Settings Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/discord-server-settings.jpg)

* As the server's settings open, you can add custom emojis in the "Emoji" tab. You can find a requirements list at the top that includes emoji names with a minimum of two characters and a file size limit of 256 KB. You can add fifty normal and an additional fifty animated emoji GIFs using the standard servers

![Upload emoji to Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/upload-emoji-discord.jpg)

* Select "Upload Emoji" to insert a custom emoji, either standard or animated
* With the help of your device's local storage, upload the file. However, for the emoji to be added to the lists, the file should align with Discord's requirements.

![Uploaded emoji on Discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/uploaded-emoji-on-discord.jpg)

* For every emoji image that you upload, an alias tag will be created for that custom emoji using the file's name. This tag is used to update a message with an emoji.
* A default alias name like this can be replaced by selecting the "Alias" box with the custom emoji and then creating a new name.
* Enjoy your emoji in chats as soon as you upload them to the Discord server!

Boost your server with Discord Nitro subscribers today to insert more than the standard fifty emoji!

How cool is it that you can add custom emoji to your smartphone as well? Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, you can use the same menu as Windows and Mac to upload emoji.

Discord's interface is similar across all devices, so the following steps work on Android and Apple.

* Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.

![Discord Server Settings Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-discord-channel-settings.jpg)

* As the channel and server list opens for Discord, you can see a three-dot menu right next to the channel list with the server name. Tap on it to proceed.
* To get to your server settings, press "Settings" in the Discord server menu that shows up.
* Under the "Server Settings" menu, select "Emoji" to access the custom emoji settings.
* As the "Emoji" menu opens, you can see an emoji requirement list
