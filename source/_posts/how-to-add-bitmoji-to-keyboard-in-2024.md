## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Similarly, as a Discord user, you must have come across thousands of emoji in it. These are images uploaded on the server and called custom emojis that this gaming community can use for effective communication with friends and other players.

With the emoji and [gaming industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/) growing, it is safe to say that discord emoji's popularity and use will only increase.

![Send emojis on Discord Chat](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/send-emoji-discord-chat.jpg)

You can access the emoji menu for all Discord platforms by pressing the grey smiley face next to the message box. This will be on the right of the box for desktops, and for mobile apps, it will be on the left.

Discord-exclusive and standard emoji are present in the emoji menu, along with a part that keeps track of your most-used emoji.

On the other hand, you can also add custom emoticons to your Discord server if you have permission to do so.

Once you add and access the emoji on your device, select the one you want to send to your friends and press enter to send.

## Part 2: How to Add Emojis To Discord Channel Name Or Nickname?

You can't remove or add emoji specific to a server on your own as a member. You need the server owner to toggle the permission of Manager Emoji in your domain.

On the other hand, as a server owner, you can give others this role with the following steps.

* **Open Roles:** Open the Server Settings and select "Roles" from the menu on the side.
* **Toggle Manage Emoji:** Pick the role you want to apply the permission to, and then toggle emoji's slider to "on," save changes, and you're done!

## FAQs About Discord Emojis

### 1\. Why Do I See Grey Emoji In The Emoji Menu?

Greyed-out emoji in the menu means that either those emoji are animated, or you don't have the permission to post them on other servers.

![grey emoji on discord  ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/grey-emoji-discord.jpg)

### 2\. How Can I Get More Custom Emoji On The Server?

You can upload 50 emojis to your Discord server. But if you want more options, you need a Discord Nitro subscription to boost your server specs.

### 3\. What Is The Discord Emoji Size?

Discord allows you to upload an emoji of up to 128x128 pixels, but it will resize it to 32x32 since that is its standard size.

**Conclusion**

Emojis make any chat fun, and where gaming is involved, they help you communicate better with your friends.

Discord has thousands of custom emojis that you can easily add to your server through your computer, whether it is your chat or the channel name. Follow our guide for a seamless process to add emoji to Discord and make your gaming experience better!

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

## Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021

So, let’s dive into them without further ado!

### 1.Magnetos

We are all familiar with the “X-Men” installations/movies and the sometimes the supervillain and evil-doer Magneto, who is smart enough to control iron?

You know, when people act some fantastic stuff but mean something else, like when they say "would die" if they don't eat that Chicken kebab! Even though it uses the literal word, it does not mean they die over a chicken wing piece; they exaggerate.

![chasing dream minion meme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/chasing-dream-minion-meme.jpg)

### 8.A Vegan Zombie

Ever met a zombie that hates meat? The one who likes to eat earthworms, grass, and grubs? Have you encountered a zombie? Well, we haven’t.

![best cook minion meme](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2021/best-cook-minion-meme.jpg)

### 10.Mum Hack

So what’s the fastest way to get down the children? Well, that can be the mobile hotspot. Turn that beautiful technology on and look for the children to rush you for the password… True?

Finally, we all agree that Minions, undoubtedly, are adorable short-sized, yellow, and clumsy but cute creatures, which, if used properly for minion memes, can motivate, cheer and improve a person's mood.

 Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he/she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:

## How to make the baby’s first year video

**Filming tips**

 Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

**Editing tips**

 Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.

**Trim, cut, or split** \- If needed, split, cut or even trim the video. There will be times when you will need the reversing effect as well. All of these effects are accessible via the Wondershare Filmora video app.

**Advanced editing** \- Plus, you will also need to apply a green screen effect as this will help you place your baby in a variety of funny locations, be it a funny MV or a Hollywood movie.
