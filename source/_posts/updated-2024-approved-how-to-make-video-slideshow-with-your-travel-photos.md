This is one of the best and most original ways you can use it in order to share your travels with others. It works magically and it manages to bring in front some of those unique moments. However, you do need to have the proper tools when you want to create such a slideshow, but that’s great as we are here to help you with that.

You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.

 **How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?**

Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.

Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

**Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.

Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

![Set up travel photo duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

![add transition to  travel photos video slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg)

**Step 5:** Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.

![export slideshow with travel photos ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg)

## 10 Most Popular Minion Memes that Moms Are Crazy About

# 10 Most Popular Minion Memes that Moms are Crazy About

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

* [Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021](#part2)
* [Part 3: Create Memes with a Free Minion Meme Generator](#part3)

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## What Is Emoji and What Does It Mean?

# What Is Emoji?

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/shannon-cox.jpg)

##### Shanoon Cox

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![ what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

### 1. Emojipedia

<https://emojipedia.org/>

![ emojipedia ](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojipedia.jpg)

Emojipedia is an online library that holds several emojis. All the emojis that the portal has are placed in their corresponding categories.

Another section on the landing page of the website contains some of the most popular emojis, i.e. those that are mostly used by the texters during their conversions. Furthermore, the name of the emoji is present right next to it, and the entire part is hyperlinked which when clicked, takes you to a new page that has all the details about the object including its meaning, alternate names, and a button to copy the emoji to the clip board. The copied element can then be pasted in the text input field of a compatible messenger such as Facebook.

### 2. EMOJI DICTIONARY

<https://www.dictionary.com/e/emoji/>

![ Emoji dictionary](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis-dictionary.jpg)

**EMOJI DICTIONARY** is another online portal that contains almost all the commonly used emojis. The upper section of the page is dedicated to ‘Featured Terms’ with a slider that has all the featured emojis. The next segment lists all the categories other than emojis.

The bottom area of the landing page has all the emojis along with their names and/or the supported devices. All the names in the section are hyperlinked that open a new page when clicked, and show all the details such as examples, usage, and origin related to that particular emoji.

### 3. Emoji Dictionary

<https://emojidictionary.emojifoundation.com/>

![ Emoji dictionary emojifoundation](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis-dictionary-emojifoundation.jpg)

This one is unique in its own way as in along with listing the most popular emojis and their names and definitions, it also allows you to include your own information in case you know something other than what is already present.

In addition to displaying the top emojis right on the landing page, the portal also has a category list where each segment holds its corresponding objects. This helps in locating your favorite elements easily and quickly. Furthermore, when you click an emoji, a new page opens up with all its definition from different aspects such as nouns, verbs, etc., along with a ‘Copy’ button that lets you copy the image to the clipboard, and use it on a compatible messaging app.

### 4. EmojiMeanings

<https://www.emojimeanings.net/>

![emojimeanings](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojimeanings.jpg)

The landing page of EmojiMeanings is populated with all the categories where each holds several relevant emojis, thus making it easier for the users to find and learn their meaning. The home page also has complete information about what emojis are, how they are different from emoticons, and what does the term ‘smiley’ actually mean.

When you click a category, a new page opens up with three major columns titled as ‘Emoji’, ‘Meaning’, and ‘Unicode’ that show an emoji itself, explain what it means, and what Unicode is used to form it respectively. All the emojis on EmojiMeanings are usually compatible with WhatsApp and Facebook.

### 5. HotEmoji

<https://hotemoji.com/emoji-meanings.html>

![ hotemoji Emoji  meaning](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/hotemoji-emoji-meanings.jpg)

HotEmoji is yet another online portal that lists almost all the emojis along with their meanings. Each entry is hyperlinked which when clicked opens a new web page dedicated to that particular emoji where all the details about it are mentioned.

The new page also has a ‘Copy’ button that can be used to copy the object to the clipboard, and then the element can be pasted onto any compatible messenger during a text conversation.

## Part 4: How to Find Emoji on Any Device?

While locating and inserting emojis on any messaging app on your smartphone is fairly simple as the messenger already has an icon that opens the entire emoji library when tapped, things are a bit tricky while using a Mac or Windows PC. Therefore, the following points explain how to find and use emojis on the computer running any of these operating systems:

#### How to Find Emojis on Windows 8 and Windows 10

On Windows 8 or Windows 10 computers, click the ‘Keyboard’ icon that is present in the ‘Notification area’ at the bottom-right corner of the screen, i.e. right side of the taskbar. When the list of emojis appears, you can click your favorite one and use it in the messenger.

#### How to Find Emojis on macOS

While using a Mac computer, you can open the app you want to add an emoji to, and then press the **ctrl** \+ **cmd** \+ **spacebar** keys on the keyboard.

## Part 5: Most Common Emoji Categories

![ Emoji type: Smiley people](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/smileys-people-emojis.jpg)

Some of the most commonly used categories that you must know after understanding **what is an emoji** include:

* **Smileys & People** – Holds the images of faces reflecting facial expressions and the vector images/animations of some popular people
* **Animals & Nature** – Contains the images/animations of animals and other natural elements such as trees, rocks, mountains, etc.

If you ever wondered **what is emoji**, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.

Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing **what is an emoji** itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.

## Part 1: What Is an Emoji?

![ what is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg)

In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.

In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also **animated** to exaggerate the message senders' emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.

The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.

## Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?

As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.

On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.

For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a **:** and **)** without space will become a smiling face, a **:** and **(** will form a sad face, and so on).

To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.

## Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?

Once you have understood **what emoji is**, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.

Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:

Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.

First, let's check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.

**The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features**

Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.

#### [Supermoji – The Emoji App](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/supermoji-the-emoji-app/id1300364926) – The Best App for Creation of Animoji and Memoji Music Videos on Old Versions of iPhones and iPads

A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model. Do you like using memoji and animoji animations to create karaoke videos you share with your friends on social media? Leave a comment below and share your opinions with us.

A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try [Facemoji](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721) or [Emoji Face Recorder](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545) apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.

**Conclusion**

Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model. Do you like using memoji and animoji animations to create karaoke videos you share with your friends on social media? Leave a comment below and share your opinions with us.

Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.

First, let's check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.

## What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?

Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017\. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.

Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.

## How to Set Up and Create Memojis?

Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.

You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.

## How to Make a Memoji or Animoji Karaoke Music Video?

Once you’ve created a memoji you will have to record thirty-second videos in order to be able to send them as messages. After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.

Read this article to learn more about Animoji: [The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.

![new-Animoj](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg)

 When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the [Animoji Studio](https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio) app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.

Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.

Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.

Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.

 It is no secret that we all lose our cool from time. It’s only natural, after all, the world can be a frustrating place. We’re all enraged by different things, some of us can’t stand pineapple on pizza while others explode when being pranked. What we often don’t realize is that being triggered in front of a camera makes us perfect meme material. Even though the majority of memes are still images, some of the [most memorable memes](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) ever created were [GIFs or short videos.](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

 Making the triggered meme is easy when you know how, so in this article, we are going to show you how to make your next potentially viral meme, in just a few easy steps.

## The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme

 Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let's get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.

#### 1. A Triggered Template

 You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called [Triggered Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en%5FUS), that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.

#### 2. A Video Editing Software

 Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.

#### 3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme

 This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of [royalty free music and sounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint

 Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.

 Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.

## How to Make a Triggered Meme?

 Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.

#### 1. Adding Media to a Project

 Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.

#### 2. Using the Green Screen Effect

 Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.

#### 3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects

 In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.

 After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.

#### 4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme

 Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.

 Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.

#### 4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora

 When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.

 The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.

**Conclusion**

 The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends. What’s your favorite method of making memes?

## The Things You Need to Make a Triggered Meme

 Preparation is key to almost every important thing in life, including making a triggered meme featuring your bestie. Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let's get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.

#### 1. A Triggered Template

 You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called [Triggered Meme Maker](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en%5FUS), that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.

#### 2. A Video Editing Software

 Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.

#### 3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme

 This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of [royalty free music and sounds](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

## Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint

 Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.

 Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.

## How to Make a Triggered Meme?

 Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.

#### 1. Adding Media to a Project

 Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.

#### 2. Using the Green Screen Effect

 Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.

#### 3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects

 In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.

 After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.

#### 4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme

 Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.

 Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.

#### 4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora

 When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.

 The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.

**Conclusion**

 The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends. What’s your favorite method of making memes?
