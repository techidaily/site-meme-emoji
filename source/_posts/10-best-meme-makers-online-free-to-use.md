# How to Make a Photo Collage on Mac/iPhone Using iPhoto?

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

### Alternative to Make a Short Video, Slideshow, or Photo Collage: Wondershare Filmora

If there are too many photos to save or share with friends and family, you can use these images to make short videos to better collage and share. Filmora can do this for you, through which you can easily crop, add effects, split the screen, and merge photos. In order to make the "photo video" lively and exciting, you can also add music, audio, animation, title, music, etc. to it.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

Above are the steps to make a photo collage using iPhoto on Mac/iPhone. We also list alternative methods to meet the different needs of the Photo library. So, if this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can also use some [online photo collage service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/) instead. If you want to have more fun editing photo stories, welcome to download Filmora and make more memorable and interesting videos.

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

# Distracted Boyfriend Meme Generator

 The Distracted Boyfriend meme is the embodiment of the awkward situation we find ourselves in when we want something other than what we already have. The original image was taken by Antonio Guillem and posted on iStock with a caption "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl". By early 2017, a few years after it was posted on iStock, the picture surfaced on social media, and it became a viral meme in a few short months. One of the first Distracted Boyfriend memes that featured a joke about staring at the sun during a solar eclipse was posted on Reddit and within 24 hours it gained 31.200 points.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/distracted-boyfriend-1.jpg)

 The meme has since become synonymous with being unfaithful to girlfriends, ideologies, scientific evidence, photo cameras or virtually anything else. Despite its popularity, it is still difficult to make a good Distracted Boyfriend meme, so let's have a look at some of the best versions of the meme that emerged on social networks.

 The Distracted Girlfriend meme became popular soon after the Distracted Boyfriend meme went viral. The photo belongs to the same series of images posted to iStock by Antonio Guillem.

 The facial expression of the girl in the photo makes it perfect meme material because she looks as if she’s just about to risk it all and do what she wants. Both Boyfriend and Girlfriend versions of this meme contain text over each of the characters in the picture. If you have a similar dilemma you can make your own version effortlessly. Here’s how.

# How to Make an Adorable Video for Your Baby's First Year

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he/she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:

## How to make the baby’s first year video

**Filming tips**

 Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

**Editing tips**

 Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.

**Adjust saturation** \- You should try to use the app in order to adjust the saturation as this can lead to some very bad results if you’re not careful. Find the proper saturation levels and opt for them right away.

**Trim, cut, or split** \- If needed, split, cut or even trim the video. There will be times when you will need the reversing effect as well. All of these effects are accessible via the Wondershare Filmora video app.

**Advanced editing** \- Plus, you will also need to apply a green screen effect as this will help you place your baby in a variety of funny locations, be it a funny MV or a Hollywood movie. The app can also help you clone the baby with PIP effects and you can also use it to add filters, overlays or text.

It also delivers immediate support for camcorders and smartphones so you can use any device you want for video capture. With its help you can share videos to DVD or YouTube too if you so desire. Don’t hesitate and access this great tool as fast as possible to get a good outcome!

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.
