![amazon prime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-amazon-prime-video.jpg)

### 6\. [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/)

Like SolarMovie, Hulu also boasts an extensive movie library. This library by Hulu is a mix of popular and classic movies. Also, it features a variety of Hulu original series and movies that you cannot find elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a thriller or a documentary, Hulu has got you covered. However, Hulu requires a paid subscription. Before subscription, you can activate a 30-day trial to weigh whether Hulu is the best SolarMovie alternative and if it is worth your time.

![hulu watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-hulu-watch-movie.jpg)

### 7\. [Yifymovies](https://yifymovies.tv/)

### 2\. [Tubi TV](https://tubitv.com/)

Tubi TV is a top-notch SolarMovie alternative site. With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more.

An option of Add To My Playlist further makes this SolarMovie alternative an excellent site.

![tubi tv watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-tubi-tv-movie.jpg)

### 3\. [Freeform](https://www.freeform.com/browse)

Among the sites like SolarMovie, Freeform also tops the list. However, Freeform is a cable channel that requires users to access the endless movie library through their cable provider. But, this SolarMovie alternative has a huge collection of the latest as well as vintage movies. On Freeform, you can watch movie online just by clicking and selecting your cable provider. You can sign up for free to resume your movie streaming from where you left off. Freeform’s movies are creatively classified as Fierce and Funny, Familiar Faves, and Throwback.

### 4\. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)

Netflix is an up-and-coming SolarMovie alternative that has dominated the online streaming sites owing to its vast movie library. Unlike SolarMovie, Netflix also produces many original movies that are available on the sites for HD streaming. Netflix, however, is not free. Users can watch movie online on Netflix by first registering for an account. After registering, users can sign in to watch movie online or download it in HD for offline streaming later. Furthermore, this SolarMovie alternative allows users to enjoy unlimited streaming on any device or platform.

![netflix watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-netflix-watch-movie.jpg)

### 5\. [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video/b?node=2676882011)

Amazon Prime is yet another top-notch SolarMovie alternative. On this site, users can find an exclusive Amazon original movie collection. With an intuitive interface and easy browsing categories, Amazon Prime is the go-to site to watch movie online without any ads or any kind of hassle. The categorization is based on genre, awards, or audience, to name a few. Also, the movies can be added to a Watchlist for easy organization. But, to watch movie online on Amazon Prime, users are required to create an account and sign in. And unlike SolarMovie, Amazon Prime isn’t available for free streaming.

![amazon prime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-amazon-prime-video.jpg)

### 6\. [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/)

Like SolarMovie, Hulu also boasts an extensive movie library. This library by Hulu is a mix of popular and classic movies. Also, it features a variety of Hulu original series and movies that you cannot find elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a thriller or a documentary, Hulu has got you covered. However, Hulu requires a paid subscription. Before subscription, you can activate a 30-day trial to weigh whether Hulu is the best SolarMovie alternative and if it is worth your time.

![hulu watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-hulu-watch-movie.jpg)

### 7\. [Yifymovies](https://yifymovies.tv/)

Another amazing SolarMovie alternative is the Yifymovies site. This site rivals the SolarMovie website by featuring an up-to-date movie collection. What’s better, Yifymovies has classified its library into broad categories like adventure, animation, and documentary, etc. Users can also search by filtering out the movies on the basis of the year of release. All the movie titles contain a rating that helps the user decide whether that movie is worth their time or not. The video player in this SolarMovie alternative features the fast-forward and rewind option too. The only downside is that it has a few annoying pop-up ads.

![yifymovies](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/7-yifymovies.jpg)

## Generating the Nut Button Meme

**Generating the Nut Button Meme**

The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word 'Nut' written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.

Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn't require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.

## A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme

Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won't necessarily make this meme as effective as you'd like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.

Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.

This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/nut-button-sample-1.jpg)

The elements of the Nut meme are always the same, although their topics can vary because the hand and the blue button are irreplaceable parts of this meme.

## Generating the Nut Button Meme

We suggest using Filmora Online Meme Maker to generate your meme because this online tool lets you create memes without watermarks for free. What's more, you don't even have to sign up in order to make a meme from images, GIFs or videos.
