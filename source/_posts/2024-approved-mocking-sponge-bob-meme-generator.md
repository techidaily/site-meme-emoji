Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. [/r/AdviceAnimals](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

![celaction2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/AdviceAnimals.JPG)

### 2. [/r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

![memeeconomy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MemeEconomy.JPG)

### 3. [/r/ComedyCemetery](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

You won't find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.

![comedycemetery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ComedyCemetery-meme.JPG)

### 4. [/r/memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

The /r/memes/ is the funniest subreddits that use phrases to show the user's emotion, physical and mental state through the linked video or image. It has 1.7million subscribers. The statements used are often ironical on the image or videos. For instance, a meme shows Keanu Reeves running with a camera and a man trying to catch him. The caption says he stole the camera from the paparazzi and ran away.

![memes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memes.JPG)

### 5. [/r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

The funniest subreddits /r/dankmemes/ are the sarcastic expressions describing the viral media jokes that have lost their comedic value or the intentionally inexplicable cliché. For example, a 7 year old boy asks, "what's virgin?" and a 9yrs old boy reverts, "allow us to introduce ourselves."

![dankmemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dankmemes.JPG)

### 6. [/r/PrequelMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

With 715k subscribers, /r/PrequelMemes deals usually with the star war memes. The photoshop memes or image macros series related to Star War films content is all about r/PrequelMemes. It helps to change the audience's opinion about the movie.

For instance, when the star war movie is about to start at 7.45 and at 7.40 you reach and your dad is still left to carry your baby brother from his car seat. You see a character from the movie asking you to leave him or else you cannot make it in time for the movie.

![prequeimemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PrequelMemes.JPG)

### 7. [/r/terriblefacebookmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

/r/terriblefacebookmemes is one of the funniest subreddits as it is a mixture of terribly shitty memes with various suggestions of granny-types. With around 216k subscribers, /r/terriblefacebookmemes is funny yet, relates to some old-fashioned ideas. For instance, a man thinking if the sun is said to be in space, why space doesn't have light and the earth instead has it?

![terriblefacebookmemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/terriblefacebookmemes.JPG)

### 8. [/r/PewdiepieSubmissions](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

/r/PewdiepieSubmissions let the users submit votes related to the competitions and submissions in pewdiepie. There are content policy violation rules where you must not post porn content or hate speech.

For instance, a long-haired dead man was found standing behind a man working on the computer and his camera captured the image. It is thought to be a cursed image and if not liked and shared, it can bring ill-fate to you, or the dead person will be in your room at night.

![pewdiepiesubmissions](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PewdiepieSubmissions.JPG)

### 9. [/r/funny](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

It is the largest humor stock collection with about a 20.8million subscribers. For example, a badge with the Apple logo says, "Does more. Cost less. It's that simple. Apple." According to the meme, Apple has changed direction as APPLE product costs a bomb in recent times.

![funny](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/funny.JPG)

### 10. [/r/teenagers/](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

Although there's no particular age specification to join, the target users are teenagers between 13-19\. One of the funniest subreddit memes shows how the teens are singing and playing instruments when they ask for $5 from Mom and get $10 in return. The joy is something out of the world.

Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.

So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. [/r/AdviceAnimals](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

![celaction2d](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/AdviceAnimals.JPG)

### 2. [/r/MemeEconomy](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

![memeeconomy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MemeEconomy.JPG)

### 3. [/r/ComedyCemetery](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

You won't find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.

### 4. [/r/memes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

The /r/memes/ is the funniest subreddits that use phrases to show the user's emotion, physical and mental state through the linked video or image. It has 1.7million subscribers. The statements used are often ironical on the image or videos. For instance, a meme shows Keanu Reeves running with a camera and a man trying to catch him. The caption says he stole the camera from the paparazzi and ran away.

![memes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memes.JPG)

### 5. [/r/dankmemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

The funniest subreddits /r/dankmemes/ are the sarcastic expressions describing the viral media jokes that have lost their comedic value or the intentionally inexplicable cliché. For example, a 7 year old boy asks, "what's virgin?" and a 9yrs old boy reverts, "allow us to introduce ourselves."

![dankmemes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/dankmemes.JPG)

### 6. [/r/PrequelMemes](https://www.reddit.com/r/AdviceAnimals/)

With 715k subscribers, /r/PrequelMemes deals usually with the star war memes. The photoshop memes or image macros series related to Star War films content is all about r/PrequelMemes. It helps to change the audience's opinion about the movie.

For instance, when the star war movie is about to start at 7.45 and at 7.40 you reach and your dad is still left to carry your baby brother from his car seat. You see a character from the movie asking you to leave him or else you cannot make it in time for the movie.

05 [Where can You Use Bitmoji?](#part5)

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

![iphone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.

**Step 4:** You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.

![iphone keyboard bitmoji option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-bitmoji-option.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, toggle the option that says Allow Full Access. Once you do that, you will see a small pop-up. Click on the Allow option.

And that’s it. Bitmoji will be added to the iPhone keyboard. Open any messaging app and click on the globe and hold it for a few seconds. When you see Bitmoji, click on that, and you will be able to use Bitmoji stickers.

## Part 3: How to Get the Bitmoji Keyboard on Android?

Bitmoji is available for Android users as well. Before you begin to use it, go through the first part again and download the app. Then create your Bitmoji, as explained earlier. You can send Bitmojis directly from the app itself, but if you plan to use Bitmoji regularly, getting the Bitmoji keyboard makes sense. So, once you are done, follow the following steps to get the Bitmoji keyboard on Android.

**Step 1:** Launch the Bitmoji app. Click on the Keyboard option that you see at the bottom of the Bitmoji app screen.

![android phone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-phone-keyboard-option.jpg)

You are all done. Now, use the Bitmoji keyboard to chat with your family members and friends and make everything fun and exciting.

## Part 4: How to Install and Use Bitmoji on Windows and Mac?

If you want to use Bitmoji on Windows and Mac, you will have to use the Google Chrome browser. If you already have the Google Chrome browser, carry on with the steps explained below; otherwise, get the browser before starting.

**Step 1:** Go to Chrome Extension and install Bitmoji for Chrome Extension.

![add bitmoji chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-bitmoji-chrome-extension.jpg)

![add bitmoji to gmail](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-bitmoji-to-gmail.jpg)

After you are done following the three easy steps, you will see Bitmoji is installed. To start using it, move the cursor to the upper corner of the browser and click on the Bitmoji icon. Next, you will see the Bitmojis. Choose any Bitmoji, copy it, and paste it on Gmail or instant messaging applications.

## Part 5: Where can You Use Bitmoji?

Bitmojis can be used on different platforms. All you need to do is enable Bitmoji keyboard on your iPhone or Android phone or Windows and Mac computers and use it on various social media platforms. For example, use Snapchat to send Bitmojis for different types of occasions.

If you are an iPhone user, you can share fun Bitmojis through iMessage. On a computer, you can use these Bitmojis on Facebook or other instant messaging platforms. You can drag and drop the Bitmoji sticker or copy it to share it with your friends.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

# Best iOS and Android Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji and Memoji Videos

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis. Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.

[![Download Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

## Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos

Even though recording thirty-second animoji and memoji videos with iPhone X, iPhone XS or iPad Pro is a quick and simple process, the time limit is still a huge obstacle to social media content creators who want to create animoji and memoji videos that surpass that limit. Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.

#### 1. [Emoji Me Animated Faces](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-me-animated-faces/id1040207175)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.

#### 2. [EMOJI Face Recorder](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.fentazy.animoji)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545), Android

You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.

#### 3. [Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721)

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes. The app lets you customize all of your facial features, and pick the shape of your nose, the color of your eyes or the accessories you want to add to the fictional character you’re creating. Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.

#### 4. [Supermoji – The Emoji App](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/supermoji-the-emoji-app/id1300364926)

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

![what-is-emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.
