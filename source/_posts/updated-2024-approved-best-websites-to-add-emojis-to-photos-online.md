## Distracted Boyfriend Meme Generator

# Distracted Boyfriend Meme Generator

![author avatar](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ollie-mattison.jpg)

##### Ollie Mattison

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

 The Distracted Boyfriend meme is the embodiment of the awkward situation we find ourselves in when we want something other than what we already have. The original image was taken by Antonio Guillem and posted on iStock with a caption "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl". By early 2017, a few years after it was posted on iStock, the picture surfaced on social media, and it became a viral meme in a few short months. One of the first Distracted Boyfriend memes that featured a joke about staring at the sun during a solar eclipse was posted on Reddit and within 24 hours it gained 31.200 points.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/distracted-boyfriend-1.jpg)

 The meme has since become synonymous with being unfaithful to girlfriends, ideologies, scientific evidence, photo cameras or virtually anything else. Despite its popularity, it is still difficult to make a good Distracted Boyfriend meme, so let's have a look at some of the best versions of the meme that emerged on social networks.

 The Distracted Girlfriend meme became popular soon after the Distracted Boyfriend meme went viral. The photo belongs to the same series of images posted to iStock by Antonio Guillem.

 The Distracted Boyfriend meme is the embodiment of the awkward situation we find ourselves in when we want something other than what we already have. The original image was taken by Antonio Guillem and posted on iStock with a caption "Disloyal man with his girlfriend looking at another girl". By early 2017, a few years after it was posted on iStock, the picture surfaced on social media, and it became a viral meme in a few short months. One of the first Distracted Boyfriend memes that featured a joke about staring at the sun during a solar eclipse was posted on Reddit and within 24 hours it gained 31.200 points.

 The meme has since become synonymous with being unfaithful to girlfriends, ideologies, scientific evidence, photo cameras or virtually anything else. Despite its popularity, it is still difficult to make a good Distracted Boyfriend meme, so let's have a look at some of the best versions of the meme that emerged on social networks.

 The Distracted Girlfriend meme became popular soon after the Distracted Boyfriend meme went viral. The photo belongs to the same series of images posted to iStock by Antonio Guillem.

 The facial expression of the girl in the photo makes it perfect meme material because she looks as if she’s just about to risk it all and do what she wants.

The small yellow faces that we have come to call emojis are now rapidly being used on all platforms. Whether you're sending an email or texting a friend, emoji is ever-present to spice up the conversation and give it an emotional touch. But these cliché emojis are now becoming dull, and the creative side in us is craving for something more personal and fun.

To satisfy that craving of being unique, you can now create your own emoji. Tease your friends with an emoji of their faces or custom-create an emoji that best expresses your facial expressions. The customized emoji can be an object or an emotion, while the only limitation is your imagination.

Let me show you how to make emoji that relates to your feelings and will help you transform your texting experience.

* [Method 1: Make Your Own Emoji Using Online Emoji Maker](#part1)

## Method 1: Make Your Own Emoji Using Online Emoji Maker

Emoji Maker is an online tool to quench your thirst for creativity. It is free and incredibly easy to use. You would think that it takes expertise to make your own emoji, but, fortunately, all it takes is imagination and a few clicks, of course.

You can create an emoji from the face shapes available or customize a funny emoji using your own or a friend's face. You can finally take revenge by pasting the funniest mustache on your ex's face or making them bald. (Savage, right?)

Better yet, you can make a superhero emoji of yourself and even change the background as if you're in the sky. The functions of this Emoji Maker are countless and of a professional level. These customized emojis are bound to make you stand out in those group chats

Now, as promised, I will show you exactly how it's done.

The small yellow faces that we have come to call emojis are now rapidly being used on all platforms. Whether you're sending an email or texting a friend, emoji is ever-present to spice up the conversation and give it an emotional touch.

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.
