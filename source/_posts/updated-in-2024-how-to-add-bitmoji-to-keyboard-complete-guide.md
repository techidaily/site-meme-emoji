## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

![create bitmoji mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bitmoji-mobile.jpg)

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

![iphone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.

**Step 4:** You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.

![iphone keyboard bitmoji option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-bitmoji-option.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, toggle the option that says Allow Full Access. Once you do that, you will see a small pop-up. Click on the Allow option.

And that’s it. Bitmoji will be added to the iPhone keyboard. Open any messaging app and click on the globe and hold it for a few seconds. When you see Bitmoji, click on that, and you will be able to use Bitmoji stickers.

## Part 3: How to Get the Bitmoji Keyboard on Android?

Bitmoji is available for Android users as well. Before you begin to use it, go through the first part again and download the app. Then create your Bitmoji, as explained earlier. You can send Bitmojis directly from the app itself, but if you plan to use Bitmoji regularly, getting the Bitmoji keyboard makes sense. So, once you are done, follow the following steps to get the Bitmoji keyboard on Android.

**Step 1:** Launch the Bitmoji app. Click on the Keyboard option that you see at the bottom of the Bitmoji app screen.

![android phone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-phone-keyboard-option.jpg)

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

**Editing tips**

 Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.

If you want to use custom emojis, you can't do so without a Nitro subscription because it is only functional on the server they are uploaded to. Even if you find a way to access the emoji from some other server, only its text code will be visible.

If you attempt to use the Emoji Picker to pick an emoji, you'll get the following message:

## Bonus: How to Manage Emoji in Discord Server?

You can't remove or add emoji specific to a server on your own as a member. You need the server owner to toggle the permission of Manager Emoji in your domain.

On the other hand, as a server owner, you can give others this role with the following steps.

* **Open Roles:** Open the Server Settings and select "Roles" from the menu on the side.
* **Toggle Manage Emoji:** Pick the role you want to apply the permission to, and then toggle emoji's slider to "on," save changes, and you're done!

## Part 4: How to Add Custom Emojis To Discord Server On iPhone And Android?

How cool is it that you can add custom emoji to your smartphone as well? Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, you can use the same menu as Windows and Mac to upload emoji.

Discord's interface is similar across all devices, so the following steps work on Android and Apple.

* Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.

![Discord Server Settings Options](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/open-discord-channel-settings.jpg)

* As the channel and server list opens for Discord, you can see a three-dot menu right next to the channel list with the server name. Tap on it to proceed.
* To get to your server settings, press "Settings" in the Discord server menu that shows up.
* Under the "Server Settings" menu, select "Emoji" to access the custom emoji settings.
* As the "Emoji" menu opens, you can see an emoji requirement list
* Press "Upload Emoji" to upload any emoji that aligns with these requirements
* Press the custom emoji file, tap "Crop" if it needs cropping, and then use the "Upload" option
* After you upload the emoji file, replace the alias tag by tapping on it. This will redirect you to that specific emoji's settings
* Type the name you want using the "Alias" box to create the tag used to insert emoji in messages
* Save this new tag with the "Save" icon placed in the bottom right
* Any changes you make to the custom emoji's alias are applied to it instantly for your use.

Emoji bring fun to the conversations you have with friends, and it is very easy to add them to your server as well. These show up in the emoji pop-up list once you add them. The chat message bar contains the emoji icon from where you can access them.

It is essential to name your emoji with only alphanumeric characters and underscores using at least two characters.

The Discord emoji size is 32x32 pixels, so even if you upload up to 128x128 pixel size emojis, they will be resized to the default dimensions. Furthermore, emoji file sizes are at most 256kb.

If you want to use custom emojis, you can't do so without a Nitro subscription because it is only functional on the server they are uploaded to. Even if you find a way to access the emoji from some other server, only its text code will be visible.

If you attempt to use the Emoji Picker to pick an emoji, you'll get the following message:

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

 **How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?**

Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.

Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

**Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.

Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

![add transition to  travel photos video slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg)

**Step 5:** Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

<!-- affiliate ads end -->
**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

Above are the steps to make a photo collage using iPhoto on Mac/iPhone. We also list alternative methods to meet the different needs of the Photo library. So, if this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can also use some [online photo collage service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/) instead. If you want to have more fun editing photo stories, welcome to download Filmora and make more memorable and interesting videos.

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.
