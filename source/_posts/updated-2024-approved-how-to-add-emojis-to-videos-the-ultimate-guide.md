![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)

Gamers, YouTubers and all other Mac and PC users who’d like to add a smiley or any other emoji to a video should try processing their footage with the Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it. You can then adjust its duration, position on the screen or size. Optionally, you can double-click on the emoji to access the Motion tab that enables you to choose between different motion effects.

###### Export the Project

Preview the results by hitting the space button on your keyboard or clicking on the Play button that is located below the app’s preview window. In case you don’t want to make any more edits to the footage, you should click on the **Export button** and choose if you want to export your project to a hard drive on your computer or to your YouTube or Vimeo channel. Select the output file format, click on the Export and wait for the rendering process to be completed.

With Filmora video editor, you can also add animated texts and titles to video, or apply various elements such as hand drawn, badges and elements for tutorial. Click to learn more details about [how to edit videos in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. Download Additional Animated Emojis from Filmostocks for Free

![Add Animated Emoji   from Filmstock to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-emoji-elements-from-Filmstock.jpg)

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from [Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You don’t have to spend any additional money on this pack that contains **24 different emojis**, but you must create an account on Filmstock before you can download the Animated Emoji Pack to your computer. The process of adding the emojis from this pack to videos is the same as the process of adding one of the emojis from the built-in Emojis category. Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button. You can check our step guide about [How to add picture to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get more clues about that.

Web-based video editing platforms like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) have been growing in popularity recently because they enable social media content creators to produce social media videos in a brief period of time. The Kapwing Meme Maker tool doesn’t feature any built-in stickers or emojis, so you must either upload a still image with a transparent ground to the platform or use its Text tool to add emojis to a video. Moreover, you won’t be able to animate the emojis you add to video clips with the Kapwing Meme Maker tool since the Kapwing platform doesn’t offer any animation tools.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free. You should keep in mind that emojis can have different meanings in different cultures, which is the reason why you must make sure that the emoji you’re adding to your video isn’t inappropriate or offensive in the context in which you’re using it. It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

## How to Add Animated Emojis to Videos in Flimora? \[Windows & Mac\][
![Download Filmora9 Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg)

Gamers, YouTubers and all other Mac and PC users who’d like to add a smiley or any other emoji to a video should try processing their footage with the Filmora [video editor](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it. You can then adjust its duration, position on the screen or size. Optionally, you can double-click on the emoji to access the Motion tab that enables you to choose between different motion effects.

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emoji-animated-effects.jpg)

###### Export the Project

Preview the results by hitting the space button on your keyboard or clicking on the Play button that is located below the app’s preview window. In case you don’t want to make any more edits to the footage, you should click on the **Export button** and choose if you want to export your project to a hard drive on your computer or to your YouTube or Vimeo channel. Select the output file format, click on the Export and wait for the rendering process to be completed.

With Filmora video editor, you can also add animated texts and titles to video, or apply various elements such as hand drawn, badges and elements for tutorial. Click to learn more details about [how to edit videos in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. Download Additional Animated Emojis from Filmostocks for Free

![Add Animated Emoji   from Filmstock to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-emoji-elements-from-Filmstock.jpg)

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from [Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You don’t have to spend any additional money on this pack that contains **24 different emojis**, but you must create an account on Filmstock before you can download the Animated Emoji Pack to your computer. The process of adding the emojis from this pack to videos is the same as the process of adding one of the emojis from the built-in Emojis category. Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button. You can check our step guide about [How to add picture to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get more clues about that.

## How to Add Emojis and Stickers to Videos on an iPhone

![Add Emoji to Video in Apple Clip](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-sticker-emoji-apple-clip.jpg)

Waiting to edit the high-resolution videos you recorded with your iPhone on a computer is not always an option, because in certain situations you just want to polish a video you recorded and post it on social media as fast as you can. The Apple’s [Clip](https://itunes.apple.com/al/app/clips/id1212699939?mt=8) app that can be downloaded for free from the AppStore seems to be a perfect solution for all iPhone users who want to add emojis to their videos before sharing them on Facebook, Instagram or any other popular social media networks.

The Clip app offers a rich selection of stickers and emojis that can be accessed by tapping on the icon that looks like a star within a circle. There are more than 30 emojis available, but you can also use the iPhone’s emoji keyboard to add emojis to videos in the Clip app. All of the app’s stickers and emojis are fully customizable, which means that you can change their size, screen position or insert text effortlessly.

## Best App for Adding Stickers and Emojis on Android Devices

## Using Kapwing Meme Maker to Add Stickers and Emojis Online

![Add Emoji to Video in Kapwing Meme Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-to-video-kapwing.jpg)

Web-based video editing platforms like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) have been growing in popularity recently because they enable social media content creators to produce social media videos in a brief period of time. The Kapwing Meme Maker tool doesn’t feature any built-in stickers or emojis, so you must either upload a still image with a transparent ground to the platform or use its Text tool to add emojis to a video. Moreover, you won’t be able to animate the emojis you add to video clips with the Kapwing Meme Maker tool since the Kapwing platform doesn’t offer any animation tools. Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

While you can mostly craft a custom emoji personalized to your style and likings, emojis are limited. Custom memoji can also be dressed and decorated to serve as the perfect mini-version of you, complete from earrings to freckles.

2.Moreover, almost everyone has the same set of emojis. But since memojis are created to look like a person, everyone has a very unique pack of memojis looking like the cartoon version of them.
