A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices.

### Step 2: Edit memes

Once you have selected the video/GIF/image you navigate to the meme editor page, you can customize your meme by tapping the tools on the left panel. The preview window there will show the changes you are doing to the imported item. Play with the text color and size in the meme and keep what suits you the most. Also, you can decide whether you wish to input text inside or outside and the file format for your meme can also be selected from this editor page.

Tips: Humorous or ironic text turns memes more popular, and don’t forget to select fonts that perfectly blend with the caption and background of the text and overall meme.

### Step 3: Export and share

At last, tap on the ‘CREATE’ button once you are happy with the creation. Allow some time, so that the meme is generated with all the aspects you have incorporated to it. Once done, hit the ‘DOWNLOAD’ button and save the meme. Well, now that everything is on point, you can share it across social media platforms such as Reddit, Facebook, or Instagram.
