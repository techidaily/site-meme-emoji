## 10 best work memes

 Here are the 10 best work memes to help you get through the working week and cheer you up to get going.

### 1\. When you think you been working for 4 hours

 The look of surprise on the boy’s face. Lol! That is exactly how people feel, when they are stressed at work and think it’s been forever they are at work, but actually it’s only a couple of minutes.

![When you think you been working for 4 hours](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/working-4-hours-meme.JPG)

### 2\. Me five minutes after getting to work

 This work meme literally made us laugh. Every minute seems longer at work and it’s funny that the meme says a cupcake is badly needed to lift the work mood.

### 3\. When you are about to leave work

 Work memes like this are so relatable. All day the boss didn’t realize something important and the moment you are about to step out, he stops you and probably assigns a work that will take ages to complete.

![When you are about to leave work](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/leave-work-meme.JPG)

### 4\. When you have been telling management

 This meme describes, you giving a damn to whatever problem is happening at work. Because even after repeated reminders to fix the issue, nobody paid attention. So, now is your turn to just chillax!

![When you have been telling management](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/telling-management-meme.JPG)

### 5\. It’s Wednesday

 Work memes like this are sarcastic. When your boss asks that you are late for work third time in the week. Your obvious response is mentally replying is it Wednesday?

![It’s Wednesday](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/wednesday-meme.jpg)

### 6\. Dress for the job you want

[Entertainment value](https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/why-publish-content-entertainment-value) is of utmost priority when you are planning for a successful meme. Though, making memes relatable to the audience is a key factor, you don’t need to be serious, just for the sake of it. Your meme should carry a witty and funny tone. You need to pick the copy and language meeting to the parameters we have just elaborated in this section.

### 2\. Keep it short

Owning to the short attention span of online users, your memes need to be pretty short, without missing the message. While you are thinking how to make a meme, keep in mind that your meme should strike the right chord with the audience and impress them at the first place. Catchy phrases, captions from popular comic series or a funny TV show that is relatable to most people can help you create an amazing image, GIF or video meme.
