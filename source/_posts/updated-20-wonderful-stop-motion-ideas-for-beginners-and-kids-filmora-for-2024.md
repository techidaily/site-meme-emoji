 **How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?**

Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.

Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

![Set up travel photo duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

![add transition to  travel photos video slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg)

![Set up travel photo duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-â€˜90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyoneâ€™s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is â€˜Ctrl + Sâ€™ which, when pressed, saves the document youâ€™re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one youâ€™re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

![use emojis on windows shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-emojis-on-windows-shortcuts.jpg)

Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.
