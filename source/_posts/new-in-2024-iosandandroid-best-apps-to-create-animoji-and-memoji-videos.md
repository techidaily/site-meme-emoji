All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis. Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.

## Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos

Even though recording thirty-second animoji and memoji videos with iPhone X, iPhone XS or iPad Pro is a quick and simple process, the time limit is still a huge obstacle to social media content creators who want to create animoji and memoji videos that surpass that limit. Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.

#### 1. Emoji Me Animated Faces

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.

#### 2. EMOJI Face Recorder

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545), Android

You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.

#### 3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS

Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.

#### 4. Supermoji – The Emoji App

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** iOS

![what-is-emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99\. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.

#### 5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters

**Price:** Free, but offers in-app purchases

**Compatibility:** [iOS](https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061), Android

Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.

#### 6. MSQRD

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** iOS, [Android](https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android)

MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.

**Samsung AR Emojis**

**Price:** Free

**Compatibility:** Samsung Galaxy series.

Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.

**Conclusion**

Animoji and memoji videos have become one of the hottest trends on social media in a relatively short period of time. Looking like a panda or creating an animated version of yourself is no longer a complicated process since you can easily customize any character you want and share it with your friends online. Which app do you like to use the most to create animoji and memoji videos? Leave a comment and let us know.

Who doesn't like emoticons? They are fun, easy to use, and, best of all, highly expressive of your emotions that you cannot convey over messages otherwise.

A 2019 survey shows 70% of [mobile users](https://www.statista.com/statistics/1068073/frequency-emoji-usage-mobile-phone-texts-social-media-mexico/) used emoji in texting or on social media daily. This shows the popularity of emoji in our world today.

Similarly, as a Discord user, you must have come across thousands of emoji in it. These are images uploaded on the server and called custom emojis that this gaming community can use for effective communication with friends and other players.

With the emoji and [gaming industry](https://www.statista.com/statistics/246892/value-of-the-video-game-market-in-the-us/) growing, it is safe to say that discord emoji's popularity and use will only increase.

* Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.

Emoji bring fun to the conversations you have with friends, and it is very easy to add them to your server as well. These show up in the emoji pop-up list once you add them. The chat message bar contains the emoji icon from where you can access them.
