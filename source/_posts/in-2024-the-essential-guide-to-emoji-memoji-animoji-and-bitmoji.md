Did you know there are 3,304 emojis as of now? Why do we even need emojis? Well, Emojis and emoticons have a long history within digital communication, internet culture, and digital content. Nowadays, emoticons have evolved into different animated versions like emoji, Bitmoji, Animoji, and Memoji. All these types of emoticons have become an important communication tool in the contemporary online world – especially on social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. If you are confused between emojis, Bitmojis, Animoji, and Memoji, read this guide to understand better!

Here is an introduction to emoji, bitmoji, Animoji, and memoji.

* [1.What Is Emoji?](#part1)
* [2.What is Animoji?](#part2)
* [3.What is Memoji?](#part3)
* [4.What is Bitmoji?](#part4)

#### 1.What Is Emoji?

Anybody with a smartphone should know what an emoji is. Open up your keypad, and the ideograms and smileys present there are called emojis.

![What Is Emoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg)

We can say that emojis are an advanced form of emoticons, but instead of typographic expressions, they are in the form of pictures. In simple words, an emoji is a small digital icon or image that expresses your emotions or ideas.

Emojis are widely used in our day-to-day communications through electronic messages and web pages. The emojis on our mobile phones exist in various genres, including facial expressions, places, food items, types of weather, animals, and other everyday objects.

Over the years, the emoji lexicon has constantly evolved to become all-inclusive as emojis are for everyone. Nowadays, emojis can be used across cultures, across screens, and across time. Whether you are white or black, Muslim or Christian, or gay or transgender, there is an emoji representing you and your culture!

#### 2.What is Animoji?

Animojis are popular on iOS devices. Apple devices include an animated emoji feature that is called Animoji. Animoji is a 3D animated emoji that responds to your facial expressions. You can create and emojis on your phone using the front camera face ID system.

![what is animoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-animoji.jpg)

Animoji is created with the facial ID software allowing the screen to record and register your facial expressions and movements. The animojis recognize and copy your facial movements like pouting, lowering eyebrow, or rolling the eyeball.

Thus, Animoji is a customized or personalized animated emoji. Animojis have a range of expressions, and they also mimic to match the audio. The current full set of Animoji includes alien, bore, bear, cat, cow, dog, chicken, fox, dragon, rabbit, and many more!

Furthermore, Animojis can be shared as a video (with sound) via different messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.

#### 3.What is Memoji?

Animojis evolve into Memojis. In simple words, Memojis are personalized Animojis. Such Animojis are 3D animated emojis that look exactly like you or an animated version of you.

![All About Memoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/all-about-memoji.jpg)

Memoji was first introduced by Apple, where the iPhone face ID camera system creates your avatar copying your facial expressions in real-time recording. Some high-end Android devices have also introduced the Memoji feature like the Samsung AR emoji.

The best thing about memojis is that you can completely customize them to suit you. From changing the shape of the head to brows, and hair color to eye color, you can make your Memoji look like you as much as possible.

Like other emojis, Memojis can also be shared on different popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.

#### 4.What is Bitmoji?

If you are an avid Snapchat user, then you must know what a Bitmoji is. Bitmojis are like Memojis, but they belong to the Bitmoji app owned by Bitstrips.

![What Is Bitmoji](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-bitmoji.jpg)

Bitstrips is a company that makes personalized emojis and cartoon avatars. Snapchat acquired Bitstrips in 2007 and later on introduced it as a feature in the Snapchat app. Over the years, Snapchat released new versions, and now it supports Bitmojis. Thus, all Snapchat users can create their own personal emojis using the Bitmoji app.

Bitmojis are customizable to a great extent allowing you to create your own cartoon version. You can also choose from a massive library of different moods and expressions, featuring your avatar.

You can also share your little cartoon versions of Bitmojis on different social media accounts. Moreover, you can put them into any chat message or even status update!

### Conclusion

If it weren’t for emojis, the online messaging world would be so boring! Emojis add a touch of fun and emotion to everything. Therefore, the majority of us today use emojis to express our emotions through digital communication.

Thus, emojis have become the language of the digital era and social media apps. So, whether you use Emojis, Animojis, Memojis, or Bitmojis, they will lighten the mood and make any conversation fun!

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

You know, when people act some fantastic stuff but mean something else, like when they say "would die" if they don't eat that Chicken kebab! Even though it uses the literal word, it does not mean they die over a chicken wing piece; they exaggerate.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

![Add Animated Emoji   from Filmstock to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-emoji-elements-from-Filmstock.jpg)

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from[Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button.

Performing basic video editing tasks like cutting or trimming the footage, choosing a soundtrack for a video or adding an emoji to a single shot or an entire sequence can all be completed in just a couple of clicks. Here’s how **you can add an emoji to a video clip in Filmora**.

#### 1. Use the Filmora’s Built-in Animated Emoji Library

###### Create a new project

Launch Filmora and then select the **New Project** option from the app’s welcome window. Afterward, you can set the project’s aspect ratio, frame rate and resolution from the **Project Settings tab** that can be accessed from the **File drop-down menu**. When done, you should proceed to import a video clip to which you want to add an emoji.

###### Place the Footage onto the Timeline

The media files you import into your projects in Filmora are located in the software’s **Media Tab**, and you can just drag them from the Media Tab and drop them onto a video track on the timeline. Remove all parts of the video clip you don’t want to use and head over to the **Elements Tab** that is located in the upper left corner of the screen.

###### Choose an Emoji

![Add Emoji to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/elements-emoji.jpg)

The Elements Tab contains different categories such as **Shapes, Badges or Pets.** Click on the **Emoji category** to start browsing through Filmora’s collection of emojis and simply drag and drop the emoji you like above the video clip to which you’d like to add it. You can then adjust its duration, position on the screen or size. Optionally, you can double-click on the emoji to access the Motion tab that enables you to choose between different motion effects.

###### Export the Project

Preview the results by hitting the space button on your keyboard or clicking on the Play button that is located below the app’s preview window. In case you don’t want to make any more edits to the footage, you should click on the **Export button** and choose if you want to export your project to a hard drive on your computer or to your YouTube or Vimeo channel. Select the output file format, click on the Export and wait for the rendering process to be completed.

With Filmora video editor, you can also add animated texts and titles to video, or apply various elements such as hand drawn, badges and elements for tutorial. Click to learn more details about[how to edit videos in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/).

#### 2. Download Additional Animated Emojis from Filmostocks for Free

![Add Animated Emoji   from Filmstock to Video in Filmora9](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/animated-emoji-elements-from-Filmstock.jpg)

There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the [Animated Emoji Pack](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) from[Filmstock effects store](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/). You don’t have to spend any additional money on this pack that contains **24 different emojis**, but you must create an account on Filmstock before you can download the Animated Emoji Pack to your computer. The process of adding the emojis from this pack to videos is the same as the process of adding one of the emojis from the built-in Emojis category. Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.

#### 3. Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora

Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.

You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button. You can check our step guide about [How to add picture to video](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) to get more clues about that.

The Apple’s [Clip](https://itunes.apple.com/al/app/clips/id1212699939?mt=8) app that can be downloaded for free from the AppStore seems to be a perfect solution for all iPhone users who want to add emojis to their videos before sharing them on Facebook, Instagram or any other popular social media networks.

## Using Kapwing Meme Maker to Add Stickers and Emojis Online

![Add Emoji to Video in Kapwing Meme Maker](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-emoji-to-video-kapwing.jpg)

Web-based video editing platforms like [Kapwing](https://www.kapwing.com/) have been growing in popularity recently because they enable social media content creators to produce social media videos in a brief period of time. The Kapwing Meme Maker tool doesn’t feature any built-in stickers or emojis, so you must either upload a still image with a transparent ground to the platform or use its Text tool to add emojis to a video. Moreover, you won’t be able to animate the emojis you add to video clips with the Kapwing Meme Maker tool since the Kapwing platform doesn’t offer any animation tools. Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.

## A Few Tips to Help you Incorporate Emojis in Your Videos

Which emoji you are going to add to a video depends on factors that range from the topic of the video to the audience you are trying to reach. So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to [emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/) or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free. You should keep in mind that emojis can have different meanings in different cultures, which is the reason why you must make sure that the emoji you’re adding to your video isn’t inappropriate or offensive in the context in which you’re using it. It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.

Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can.

## How to make the baby’s first year video

**Filming tips**

 Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

**Editing tips**

 Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.
