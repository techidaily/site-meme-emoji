The honeymoon is maybe one of the most important times in our life.

But if you go on a honeymoon, you do want to have a video that you can cherish forever, don’t you? If you do, here are example of fancy honey moon video and some of the best ideas that you can use to create the best, most immersive and memorable honeymoon video.

## Tips on creating a memorable honeymoon video

**Choosing the right camera**

There are many affordable [1080p or 4k cameras](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) that you can use and all of them come with various features and prices. Obviously, you should try and focus on finding the right one that suits your needs. Take your time and study the prices and features then select the one you want based on your budget and expertise.

**Get lots of photos**

Another great tip is that you need to get as many photos as you can. No matter where you choose to go, there are tons of scenes, people, monuments and landmarks that you can choose to photograph. Take your time and try to capture as many of them as you possibly can. Granted, it will take a little bit of time but it will offer you the insight and fun you need in order to have a great slideshow in the end.

 **Organize a story from your photos**

Once you have the photos, you should try to organize a story from the images. The best honeymoon movies are the ones that include a story so think about that and you will have quite a bit of fun as you immerse yourself into this experience, that’s for sure.

 **Add songs and overlays**

You should try and consider adding songs and overlays because this will make the movie more fun and immersive. Once you complete it, you will need to share it with friends and family!

### 3\. When you are about to leave work

 Work memes like this are so relatable. All day the boss didn’t realize something important and the moment you are about to step out, he stops you and probably assigns a work that will take ages to complete.

### 2\. Me five minutes after getting to work

 This work meme literally made us laugh. Every minute seems longer at work and it’s funny that the meme says a cupcake is badly needed to lift the work mood.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

## Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021

The delayed-release **"Minions: The Rise of Gru"** is no laughing concern, but there'll be miles into smiles with or top collection of minion memes that include all **funny minion memes**, **Facebook minion memes**, and more.

So, let’s dive into them without further ado!

Finally, we all agree that Minions, undoubtedly, are adorable short-sized, yellow, and clumsy but cute creatures, which, if used properly for minion memes, can motivate, cheer and improve a person's mood. They always try to shove in distinct words that generally make it a blow-off. And that can be awkward and odd as well.

However, as a bonus tip, we've mentioned all kinds of minion memes, including a free minion meme generator. So, try out these special memes through meme generators and let us know if you find our content helpful and valuable.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

Above are the steps to make a photo collage using iPhoto on Mac/iPhone. We also list alternative methods to meet the different needs of the Photo library. So, if this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can also use some [online photo collage service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/) instead. If you want to have more fun editing photo stories, welcome to download Filmora and make more memorable and interesting videos.
