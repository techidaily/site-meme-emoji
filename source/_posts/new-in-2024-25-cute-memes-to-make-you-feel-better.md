## How to Add Bitmoji to Keyboard?

[Emojis](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) have made it so much better for people to express themselves. Let’s say someone compliments you on a chat app; you can use a smiley emoji to tell that you are happy. At the same time, an angry emoji lets you express that you are angry.

Apart from the generic emojis that you can find in your chat applications, Bitmoji enables you to customize your character and share it with people you chat with. Bitmoji is fun, but do you know how to add it to a keyboard? If you don’t, don’t worry, this post will help you understand how to do that.

#### In this article

01 [What is Bitmoji?](#part1)

02 [How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?](#part2)

03 [How to Get the Bitmoji Keyboard on Android?](#part3)

04 [How to Install and Use Bitmoji on Windows and Mac?](#part4)

05 [Where can You Use Bitmoji?](#part5)

## Part 1: What is Bitmoji?

If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.

Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.

Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.

**Step 1:** First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.

**Step 2:** Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.

**Step 3:** Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.

![create bitmoji mobile](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-bitmoji-mobile.jpg)

Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.

## Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?

Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.

**Step 1:** Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.

**Step 2:** Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.

![iphone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-option.jpg)

**Step 3:** When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.

**Step 4:** You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.

![iphone keyboard bitmoji option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-bitmoji-option.jpg)

**Step 5:** Now, toggle the option that says Allow Full Access. Once you do that, you will see a small pop-up. Click on the Allow option.

And that’s it. Bitmoji will be added to the iPhone keyboard. Open any messaging app and click on the globe and hold it for a few seconds. When you see Bitmoji, click on that, and you will be able to use Bitmoji stickers.

## Part 3: How to Get the Bitmoji Keyboard on Android?

Bitmoji is available for Android users as well. Before you begin to use it, go through the first part again and download the app. Then create your Bitmoji, as explained earlier. You can send Bitmojis directly from the app itself, but if you plan to use Bitmoji regularly, getting the Bitmoji keyboard makes sense. So, once you are done, follow the following steps to get the Bitmoji keyboard on Android.

**Step 1:** Launch the Bitmoji app. Click on the Keyboard option that you see at the bottom of the Bitmoji app screen.

![android phone keyboard option](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/android-phone-keyboard-option.jpg)

![enable bitmoji android](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/enable-bitmoji-android.jpg)

You are all done. Now, use the Bitmoji keyboard to chat with your family members and friends and make everything fun and exciting.

## Part 4: How to Install and Use Bitmoji on Windows and Mac?

If you want to use Bitmoji on Windows and Mac, you will have to use the Google Chrome browser. If you already have the Google Chrome browser, carry on with the steps explained below; otherwise, get the browser before starting.

**Step 1:** Go to Chrome Extension and install Bitmoji for Chrome Extension.

![add bitmoji chrome extension](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/add-bitmoji-chrome-extension.jpg)

After you are done following the three easy steps, you will see Bitmoji is installed. To start using it, move the cursor to the upper corner of the browser and click on the Bitmoji icon. Next, you will see the Bitmojis. Choose any Bitmoji, copy it, and paste it on Gmail or instant messaging applications.

## Part 5: Where can You Use Bitmoji?

Bitmojis can be used on different platforms. All you need to do is enable Bitmoji keyboard on your iPhone or Android phone or Windows and Mac computers and use it on various social media platforms. For example, use Snapchat to send Bitmojis for different types of occasions.

If you are an iPhone user, you can share fun Bitmojis through iMessage. On a computer, you can use these Bitmojis on Facebook or other instant messaging platforms. You can drag and drop the Bitmoji sticker or copy it to share it with your friends.

 **How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?**

Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.

Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

**Step 1:** Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.

Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

![Set up travel photo duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

![add transition to  travel photos video slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg)

**Step 5:** Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully.
