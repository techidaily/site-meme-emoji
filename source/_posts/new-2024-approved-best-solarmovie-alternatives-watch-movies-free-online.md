 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

SolarMovie is an online video streaming site that offers a huge collection of movies and TV series. All these movies and shows can be streamed for free on SolarMovie. Furthermore, there is no registration required. Better yet, users can even download the movies in high quality.

However, some ISP’s have banned the SolarMovie website, and it might be inaccessible now. So, people are now on the lookout for a SolarMovie alternative that they can use to easily watch movie online.

To help with that, we have carefully curated a list of some of the top sites like SolarMovie.

* [Best 10 SolarMovie Alternatives for You](#part11)
* [Bonus Tip- Make a Video with Wondershare Filmora Easy Movie Maker](#part12)

## Best 10 SolarMovie Alternatives for You

Even though there countless SolarMovie like websites on the internet, it can be pretty confusing to find the best one. Therefore, we have rounded up the top SolarMovie alternative sites for your ease.

* [1\. Popcornflix](#part1)
* [2\. Tubi TV](#part2)
* [3\. Freeform](#part3)
* [4\. Netflix](#part4)
* [5\. Amazon Prime](#part5)
* [6\. Hulu](#part6)
* [7\. Yifymovies](#part7)
* [8\. CONtv](#part8)
* [9\. Aha Video](#part9)
* [10\. Vumoo](#part10)

### 1\. [Popcornflix](https://www.popcornflix.com/pages/discover/d/movies)

One of the best SolarMovie alternative sites includes Popcornflix. It is a free HD streaming site through which users can watch movie online without having to register or subscribe. The range of movies available on this SolarMovie alternative is very extensive. Moreover, the movies are categorized as New Arrivals, Horror, Drama, Asian Action, to name a few. The categorization allows easy browsing and searching for the perfect movie. This SolarMovie alternative boasts a category of Popcornflix original movies as well that are exclusively available on this site. A search bar option further eases the task of finding a particular movie.

![popcornflix watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/1-popcornflix-movie.jpg)

### 2\. [Tubi TV](https://tubitv.com/)

Tubi TV is a top-notch SolarMovie alternative site. With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more. By selecting a title from the genre category like horror, lifestyle, or even stand-up comedy, users can easily find and watch movie online. This site might even be better than SolarMovie, as it has options to customize the resolution and the choice to display subtitles. An option of Add To My Playlist further makes this SolarMovie alternative an excellent site.

![tubi tv watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/2-tubi-tv-movie.jpg)

### 3\. [Freeform](https://www.freeform.com/browse)

Among the sites like SolarMovie, Freeform also tops the list. However, Freeform is a cable channel that requires users to access the endless movie library through their cable provider. But, this SolarMovie alternative has a huge collection of the latest as well as vintage movies. On Freeform, you can watch movie online just by clicking and selecting your cable provider. You can sign up for free to resume your movie streaming from where you left off. Freeform’s movies are creatively classified as Fierce and Funny, Familiar Faves, and Throwback.

![freeform movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/3-freeform-movie.jpg)

### 4\. [Netflix](https://www.netflix.com/)

Netflix is an up-and-coming SolarMovie alternative that has dominated the online streaming sites owing to its vast movie library. Unlike SolarMovie, Netflix also produces many original movies that are available on the sites for HD streaming. Netflix, however, is not free. Users can watch movie online on Netflix by first registering for an account. After registering, users can sign in to watch movie online or download it in HD for offline streaming later. Furthermore, this SolarMovie alternative allows users to enjoy unlimited streaming on any device or platform.

![netflix watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/4-netflix-watch-movie.jpg)

### 5\. [Amazon Prime](https://www.amazon.com/Prime-Video/b?node=2676882011)

Amazon Prime is yet another top-notch SolarMovie alternative. On this site, users can find an exclusive Amazon original movie collection. With an intuitive interface and easy browsing categories, Amazon Prime is the go-to site to watch movie online without any ads or any kind of hassle. The categorization is based on genre, awards, or audience, to name a few. Also, the movies can be added to a Watchlist for easy organization. But, to watch movie online on Amazon Prime, users are required to create an account and sign in. And unlike SolarMovie, Amazon Prime isn’t available for free streaming.

![amazon prime video](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/5-amazon-prime-video.jpg)

### 6\. [Hulu](https://www.hulu.com/)

Like SolarMovie, Hulu also boasts an extensive movie library. This library by Hulu is a mix of popular and classic movies. Also, it features a variety of Hulu original series and movies that you cannot find elsewhere. Whether you want to watch a thriller or a documentary, Hulu has got you covered. However, Hulu requires a paid subscription. Before subscription, you can activate a 30-day trial to weigh whether Hulu is the best SolarMovie alternative and if it is worth your time.

![hulu watch movie](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/6-hulu-watch-movie.jpg)

### 7\. [Yifymovies](https://yifymovies.tv/)

Another amazing SolarMovie alternative is the Yifymovies site. This site rivals the SolarMovie website by featuring an up-to-date movie collection. What’s better, Yifymovies has classified its library into broad categories like adventure, animation, and documentary, etc. Users can also search by filtering out the movies on the basis of the year of release. All the movie titles contain a rating that helps the user decide whether that movie is worth their time or not. The video player in this SolarMovie alternative features the fast-forward and rewind option too. The only downside is that it has a few annoying pop-up ads.

# How to Make a Photo Collage on Mac/iPhone Using iPhoto?

iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

### Alternative to Make a Short Video, Slideshow, or Photo Collage: [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

If there are too many photos to save or share with friends and family, you can use these images to make short videos to better collage and share. Filmora can do this for you, through which you can easily crop, add effects, split the screen, and merge photos. In order to make the "photo video" lively and exciting, you can also add music, audio, animation, title, music, etc. to it.

[![Download Filmora Win Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-win.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) [![Download Filmora Mac Version](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/guide/download-btn-mac.jpg) ](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/)

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: [iCloud](https://www.icloud.com/)

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

Above are the steps to make a photo collage using iPhoto on Mac/iPhone. We also list alternative methods to meet the different needs of the Photo library. So, if this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can also use some [online photo collage service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/) instead. If you want to have more fun editing photo stories, welcome to download Filmora and make more memorable and interesting videos.
