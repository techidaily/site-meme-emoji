iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.

**Update:** On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.

The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.

* **[Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?](#part1)**
* **[Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?](#part2)**

## Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?

Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.

**Step 1:** Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.

**Step 2:** Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.

**Step 3:** Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select **Card** in the pop-up window.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG)

**Step 4:** Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the **Any Occasion** section if you are using the iPhoto 11.

**Step 5:** You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.

**Step 6:** Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.

![add photo by iphoto](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG)

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

### Conclusion

So, if this isn’t quite what you’re looking for, you can also use some [online photo collage service](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/fotophire/download/) instead.

**Step 7:** Click the **Buy** button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the **Share** menu and email it to yourself or family members.

But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:

1. Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.
2. The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.
3. iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.

## Part 2: What Replaces iPhoto on Mac/iPhone?

Since iPhoto's functions are not sufficient, we will introduce some alternative collage makers that you may be interested in.

### Alternative to Make a Short Video, Slideshow, or Photo Collage: Wondershare Filmora

### Alternative to Organize, Store, and Sort Images: iCloud

Migrating your photos to iCloud is a wise choice. iCloud is the best photo storage for iOS or Mac users. You don't need to download other apps or software. Just allow iCloud to back up the photo's library in the settings.

The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening "Shared Album". However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.

## 10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes

### 1. /r/AdviceAnimals

On 7th December 2010, the /r/AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.

The funniest subreddits on /r/AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read "Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there's nobody else there."/r/AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as "there's someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead."

### 2. /r/MemeEconomy

r/MemeEconomy is a quirky and funniest subreddit where real-world commodities are discussed through memes. There's no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.

For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.

![memeeconomy](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/MemeEconomy.JPG)

### 3. /r/ComedyCemetery

/r/ComedyCemetery is one of the funniest subreddit where the memes are shared by people and mocked them to try out their humor. To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.

You won't find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, "Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don't be said. I'll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you." Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.

![comedycemetery](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/ComedyCemetery-meme.JPG)

### 4. /r/memes

The /r/memes/ is the funniest subreddits that use phrases to show the user's emotion, physical and mental state through the linked video or image. It has 1.7million subscribers. The statements used are often ironical on the image or videos. For instance, a meme shows Keanu Reeves running with a camera and a man trying to catch him. The caption says he stole the camera from the paparazzi and ran away.

![memes](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/memes.JPG)

### 5. /r/dankmemes

The funniest subreddits /r/dankmemes/ are the sarcastic expressions describing the viral media jokes that have lost their comedic value or the intentionally inexplicable cliché. For example, a 7 year old boy asks, "what's virgin?" and a 9yrs old boy reverts, "allow us to introduce ourselves."

 Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he/she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:

## How to make the baby’s first year video

**Filming tips**

 Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

**Editing tips**

 Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.

**Adjust saturation** \- You should try to use the app in order to adjust the saturation as this can lead to some very bad results if you’re not careful. Find the proper saturation levels and opt for them right away.

**Trim, cut, or split** \- If needed, split, cut or even trim the video. There will be times when you will need the reversing effect as well. All of these effects are accessible via the Wondershare Filmora video app.

**Advanced editing** \- Plus, you will also need to apply a green screen effect as this will help you place your baby in a variety of funny locations, be it a funny MV or a Hollywood movie. The app can also help you clone the baby with PIP effects and you can also use it to add filters, overlays or text.

 Wondershare Filmora will offer you an extraordinary set of tools and it will bring in front a very good value right from the start. The interface of the app is user friendly and you will have no problem using it as you see fit. Also, you can create the baby’s first year video on both Mac and Windows as the app supports both platforms. It also delivers immediate support for camcorders and smartphones so you can use any device you want for video capture. With its help you can share videos to DVD or YouTube too if you so desire. Don’t hesitate and access this great tool as fast as possible to get a good outcome!

## How to make the baby’s first year video

**Filming tips**

 Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

### FLV Slideshow Tips

 For more detailed settings of FLV slideshow, click Settings button and specify various options, like encoder, resolution, frame rate, bit rate and audio settings.

 To play FLV slideshow on Nokia mobile phone, you should set encode type to Nokia FLV series (\*.flv). Once created, upload flv to Nokia phone or online and view FLV slideshow using FLV player or web browser plugin.

 You could also **upload FLV slideshow to YouTube** to share with more people. FLV videos are perfectly supported by YouTube.

#### More: Convert All Popular Formats to FLV

[Wondershare DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/dvd-slideshow-builder-deluxe/download/) supports all popular video formats. Therefore, you can import videos that need to change format, and save it in another format. It's not only a DVD slideshow maker, but only powerful FLV converter. For detailed supported input formats, check video format references.

#### More: Convert FLV to MP4, AVI, MOV, MPEG or Burn FLV to DVD

 You could also import FLV to DVD Slideshow Builder Deluxe and save it as MP4, AVI, MOV and 3GP, or even burn FLV video to DVD with beautiful DVD menus. For detailed supported output formats, check video format references. Here, I recommended to **save FLV to MP4** for its comprehensive support on various devices, such as iPhone, iPod, Apple TV, Gphone, Nokia phone, LG phone, PSP, Palm, Zune, etc.
