 Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he/she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:

## How to make the baby’s first year video

**Filming tips**

 Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.

**Stabilize the camera** \- The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.

**Lighting** \- You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.

**Focus** \- Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.

**Audio** \- Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.

**Props** \- Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.

**Editing tips**

 Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, [Wondershare Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.

## How can you create a travel slideshow with travel photos

**Things you need to know before creating it**

You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.

Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don't need to adjust the photo duration one by one.

![Set up travel photo duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

![Add music on travel photo slideshow](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg)

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

## How can you create a travel slideshow with travel photos

**Things you need to know before creating it**

Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.

You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.

[Filmstock Stock Media Library](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg)](https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle)

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg)

![Set up travel photo duration](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg)

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

**Step 2:** Now, it's time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.

If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can [use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) and mark the highlights accordingly.

**Step 3:** Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.

You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.

![How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg)

**Step 4:** At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.

When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

* **Emojis** – Contains various emojis and smileys
* **GIF** – Gives you access to various animated GIFs from Tenor
* **Kamojis** – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(
* **Symbols** – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.

In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.

**Conclusion**

While the emojis were introduced to Windows as late as 2012, Windows 11 has a wide range of these virtual objects or faces for various occasions and to convey different expressions respectively. Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.

Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <http://www.iemoji.com/>, and using the options that the website offers. All in all, it’s easy to learn **how to use emojis on Windows** as long as you have access to the correct tutorial that explains the process in an easy manner.

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

### Conclusion

Finally, we all agree that Minions, undoubtedly, are adorable short-sized, yellow, and clumsy but cute creatures, which, if used properly for minion memes, can motivate, cheer and improve a person's mood. They always try to shove in distinct words that generally make it a blow-off. And that can be awkward and odd as well.

However, as a bonus tip, we've mentioned all kinds of minion memes, including a free minion meme generator. So, try out these special memes through meme generators and let us know if you find our content helpful and valuable.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

## Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021

The delayed-release **"Minions: The Rise of Gru"** is no laughing concern, but there'll be miles into smiles with or top collection of minion memes that include all **funny minion memes**, **Facebook minion memes**, and more.

So, let’s dive into them without further ado!

### 7.Chasing my dream

You know, when people act some fantastic stuff but mean something else, like when they say "would die" if they don't eat that Chicken kebab! Even though it uses the literal word, it does not mean they die over a chicken wing piece; they exaggerate.

 Mar 27, 2024• Proven solutions

Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald's. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”

They've also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions' abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.

A **Minion meme** is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one's cooking.

Leading with the fact, we'll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.

## Part 1: Who Invented Minion Memes?

Who is to blame for pushing things down my throat day after day? It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, **Pierre Coffin**. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.

There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.

## Part 2: Top 10 Minion Memes of 2021
