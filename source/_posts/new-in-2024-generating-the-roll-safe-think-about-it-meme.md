 Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we've all made more foolish assumptions than we'd care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they've become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the _Hood Documentary_ series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: '_You can't be broke if you don't check your bank account'_ went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.

 Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we're going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.

## A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

 Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you'd like to achieve.

![](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-1.jpg)

_Can't lose_ _if you don't play_ is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don't try something you can't fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it's not, and that's the catch.

 A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren't in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you'll never be in a relationship.

 We all complain about financial troubles in one way or the other, and Roll Safe-Think About It offers a pretty funny way to do that. Once again, a seemingly valid point that only looks good in theory is the punch-line of the meme. There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.

## How to Make the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme

 Generating a meme with the [Filmora Online Meme Maker](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/) is free, quick and easy, and you can also use it to create memes from your Smartphone.

#### 2\. Adding the Text to The Meme

 Below the Text, Inside and Text Outside options you'll be able to spot text boxes where you can add the punch-line of the meme. In the Text Options menu, you can select a new font, choose the text alignment you like the most or change the size and the color of the text.

_Can't lose_ _if you don't play_ is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don't try something you can't fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it's not, and that's the catch.

 A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren't in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you'll never be in a relationship.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

## Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme

Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.

1. Be Witty

The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.

2. Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends

You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.

3. Use Good Quality Video and Images

You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.

4. Consider If It Works for the Audience

There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.

#### Conclusion

Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like [FilmoraX](https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/), the job becomes even easier.

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

## Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows

Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.

With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.

## Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts

A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.

While learning the process of **how to use emoji in Windows 10**, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.

Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:

* Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example
* Press the **Windows** \+ **;** (semicolon) or **Windows** \+ **.** (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard

![use emojis on windows shortcuts](https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/use-emojis-on-windows-shortcuts.jpg)

Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.

As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:

**:** (colon) + **)** (right brace) will create a smiley face

**:** (colon) + **(** (left brace) will create a sad face

**:** (colon) + **;** (semicolon) will create a wink face

…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:
