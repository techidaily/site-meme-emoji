<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project"></a>Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project</h4><p>Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.</p>
<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video</h4><p>iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.</p>
<p>If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It’s a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.</p>

<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

Export and Share Your Slideshow video</h4><p>Play the slideshow and check the result in the preview window. If everything goes well, you can now export and share or save it. You can save the slideshow video in MP4 format, or share it to Vimeo or add the slideshow to Theater to load it on your other Apple devices so you can easily watch it on your iOS devices or Apple TV.</p>
<p>I hope the above tutorial about how to make a slideshow on iMovie will be helpful for your stunning slideshow creation.</p>
<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-3"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-3" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project"></a>Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project</h4><p>Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.</p>
<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.</p>
<p>If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It’s a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme</h2><p>Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won’t necessarily make this meme as effective as you’d like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.</p>
<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-2"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-2" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme</h2><p>Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won’t necessarily make this meme as effective as you’d like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.</p>
<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

<p>Did you know there are 3,304 emojis as of now? Why do we even need emojis? Well, Emojis and emoticons have a long history within digital communication, internet culture, and digital content. Nowadays, emoticons have evolved into different animated versions like emoji, Bitmoji, Animoji, and Memoji. All these types of emoticons have become an important communication tool in the contemporary online world – especially on social media apps like Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat. If you are confused between emojis, Bitmojis, Animoji, and Memoji, read this guide to understand better!</p>
<p>Here is an introduction to emoji, bitmoji, Animoji, and memoji.</p>

</ul>
<h4 id="1-What-Is-Emoji"><a href="#1-What-Is-Emoji" class="headerlink" title="1.What Is Emoji?"></a>1.What Is Emoji?</h4><p>Anybody with a smartphone should know what an emoji is. Open up your keypad, and the ideograms and smileys present there are called emojis.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-emoji.jpg"
                      alt="What Is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>We can say that emojis are an advanced form of emoticons, but instead of typographic expressions, they are in the form of pictures. In simple words, an emoji is a small digital icon or image that expresses your emotions or ideas.</p>
<p>Emojis are widely used in our day-to-day communications through electronic messages and web pages. The emojis on our mobile phones exist in various genres, including facial expressions, places, food items, types of weather, animals, and other everyday objects.</p>
<p>Over the years, the emoji lexicon has constantly evolved to become all-inclusive as emojis are for everyone. Nowadays, emojis can be used across cultures, across screens, and across time. Whether you are white or black, Muslim or Christian, or gay or transgender, there is an emoji representing you and your culture!</p>
<h4 id="2-What-is-Animoji"><a href="#2-What-is-Animoji" class="headerlink" title="2.What is Animoji?"></a>2.What is Animoji?</h4><p>Animojis are popular on iOS devices. Apple devices include an animated emoji feature that is called Animoji. Animoji is a 3D animated emoji that responds to your facial expressions. You can create and emojis on your phone using the front camera face ID system.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/what-is-animoji.jpg"
                      alt="what is animoji"
                ></p>
<p>Animoji is created with the facial ID software allowing the screen to record and register your facial expressions and movements. The animojis recognize and copy your facial movements like pouting, lowering eyebrow, or rolling the eyeball.</p>
<p>Thus, Animoji is a customized or personalized animated emoji. Animojis have a range of expressions, and they also mimic to match the audio. The current full set of Animoji includes alien, bore, bear, cat, cow, dog, chicken, fox, dragon, rabbit, and many more!</p>
<p>Furthermore, Animojis can be shared as a video (with sound) via different messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.</p>
<h4 id="3-What-is-Memoji"><a href="#3-What-is-Memoji" class="headerlink" title="3.What is Memoji?"></a>3.What is Memoji?</h4><p>Animojis evolve into Memojis. In simple words, Memojis are personalized Animojis. Such Animojis are 3D animated emojis that look exactly like you or an animated version of you.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="All About Memoji"
                ></p>
<p>Memoji was first introduced by Apple, where the iPhone face ID camera system creates your avatar copying your facial expressions in real-time recording. Some high-end Android devices have also introduced the Memoji feature like the Samsung AR emoji.</p>
<p>The best thing about memojis is that you can completely customize them to suit you. From changing the shape of the head to brows, and hair color to eye color, you can make your Memoji look like you as much as possible.</p>
<p>Like other emojis, Memojis can also be shared on different popular messaging apps like WhatsApp, Facebook, and Instagram.</p>
<h4 id="4-What-is-Bitmoji"><a href="#4-What-is-Bitmoji" class="headerlink" title="4.What is Bitmoji?"></a>4.What is Bitmoji?</h4><p>If you are an avid Snapchat user, then you must know what a Bitmoji is. Bitmojis are like Memojis, but they belong to the Bitmoji app owned by Bitstrips.</p>
<p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="What Is Bitmoji"
                ></p>
<p>Bitstrips is a company that makes personalized emojis and cartoon avatars. Snapchat acquired Bitstrips in 2007 and later on introduced it as a feature in the Snapchat app. Over the years, Snapchat released new versions, and now it supports Bitmojis. Thus, all Snapchat users can create their own personal emojis using the Bitmoji app.</p>
<p>Bitmojis are customizable to a great extent allowing you to create your own cartoon version. You can also choose from a massive library of different moods and expressions, featuring your avatar.</p>
<p>You can also share your little cartoon versions of Bitmojis on different social media accounts. Moreover, you can put them into any chat message or even status update!</p>

<p>All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis.

On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos.

Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.</p>
<h4 id="1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces"><a href="#1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces" class="headerlink" title="1. Emoji Me Animated Faces"></a>1. Emoji Me Animated Faces</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.</p>
<h4 id="2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder"><a href="#2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. EMOJI Face Recorder"></a>2. EMOJI Face Recorder</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

<p>You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.</p>
<h4 id="3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar"><a href="#3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar" class="headerlink" title="3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar"></a>3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

<p>Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes.

Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.</p>

                      alt="what-is-emoji"
                ></p>
<p>This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>
<h4 id="5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters"><a href="#5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters" class="headerlink" title="5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters"></a>5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

<p>Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>
<h4 id="6-MSQRD"><a href="#6-MSQRD" class="headerlink" title="6. MSQRD"></a>6. MSQRD</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung AR Emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Samsung Galaxy series.</p>
<p>Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>

The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>

The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable.

The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

<p> <strong>How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?</strong></p>
<p>Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"

<p> <strong>How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?</strong></p>
<p>Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"
