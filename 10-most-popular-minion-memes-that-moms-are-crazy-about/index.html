<p>Minions have successfully occupied global pop culture. In 2015, Universal Pictures made a record by spending $600 million on Minions marketing, partnering with Tic Tac, Converse, Amazon, and McDonald’s. In addition, minions were an inspiration for numerous products, creating a kind of signifier for their film and signifying a sense that they were “freaking everywhere.”</p>
<p>They’ve also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions’ abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.</p>
<p>A <strong>Minion meme</strong> is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one’s cooking.</p>
<p>Leading with the fact, we’ll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.</p>

It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, <strong>Pierre Coffin</strong>. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.</p>
<p>There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.</p>

<p>They’ve also infiltrated the Internet. The Minions’ abstractness let them known as ripe for meme-ing, which you can combine with any joke, idiom, or feeling.</p>
<p>A <strong>Minion meme</strong> is rarely crude, and generally, they are helpful for self-deprecating jabs or fart-jokes at one’s cooking.</p>
<p>Leading with the fact, we’ll discuss all the minion memes, how to make them, and their different types.</p>

It would be simple enough to blame Obama, Universal Studios, or even the guy who invented Minions, <strong>Pierre Coffin</strong>. But none of them is actually at fault. They were only providing humankind with the weapon, and humanity chose to use that evil weapon.</p>
<p>There have been loads of discussions about how Minions have dishonored the excellent name of the meme, rendering humor and creativity obsolete. But we are still entirely astonished as to why Minions shine from the big screen and leaked all over smartphones.</p>

<p>So, let’s dive into them without further ado!</p>

Import Photos, Videos, and Audio Files</h4><p>Now go to the My Media tab and click the Import icon to add your photos, videos, and music to iMovie, in this way, you can import any media files from any location on your Mac. But if you have arranged all your videos, photos, and music tracks in the Photos app, you can just switch to Photos under the Libraries tab on the left to import.</p>

To apply a transition in the slideshow, just drag and drop it between two photos in the timeline.</p>

<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

<h4 id="Step-2-Add-Music-to-Your-iMovie-Slideshow-Project"><a href="#Step-2-Add-Music-to-Your-iMovie-Slideshow-Project" class="headerlink" title="Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project"></a>Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project</h4><p>Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.</p>
<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-1"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-1" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project"></a>Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project</h4><p>Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.</p>
<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.</p>
<h3 id="The-significant-elements-are"><a href="#The-significant-elements-are" class="headerlink" title="The significant elements are:"></a><strong>The significant elements are:</strong></h3><ul>
<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.</p>
<p>To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.</p>
<p>However, even for the beginner, the home could be the best option instead of a studio.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.</p>
<p>The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.</p>
<p>For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.</p>
<p>Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it’s right for you, but there is no commitment involved.</p>

<p>MakeStoryboard provides a simple, straightforward interface for uploading camera shots, drawing stick figures with its built-in tool, and incorporating text for scene details if you are not interested in the fancier options in the list. In addition, any drawing tablet can be used with marker, pencil, and pen tools.</p>
<p>Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you’re ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method.

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-16"><a href="#Conclusion-16" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-17"><a href="#Conclusion-17" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>
<p>The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>
