Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully.

Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it.

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Bitmoji-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Bitmoji-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Bitmoji?"></a>Part 1: What is Bitmoji?</h2><p>If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.</p>
<p>Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="create bitmoji mobile"
                ></p>
<p>Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-and-Use-Bitmoji-to-iPhone-Keyboard-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-and-Use-Bitmoji-to-iPhone-Keyboard-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?"></a>Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?</h2><p>Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iphone keyboard option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="iphone keyboard bitmoji option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, toggle the option that says Allow Full Access. Once you do that, you will see a small pop-up. Click on the Allow option.</p>
<p>And that’s it. Bitmoji will be added to the iPhone keyboard. Open any messaging app and click on the globe and hold it for a few seconds. When you see Bitmoji, click on that, and you will be able to use Bitmoji stickers.</p>

Before you begin to use it, go through the first part again and download the app. Then create your Bitmoji, as explained earlier. You can send Bitmojis directly from the app itself, but if you plan to use Bitmoji regularly, getting the Bitmoji keyboard makes sense. So, once you are done, follow the following steps to get the Bitmoji keyboard on Android.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Bitmoji app. Click on the Keyboard option that you see at the bottom of the Bitmoji app screen.</p>

Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-select-image.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-background.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid Background"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>

Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-select-image.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-background.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid Background"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>

<p>Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.</p>
<p>First, let’s check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?"></a>What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?</h2><p>Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.</p>
<p>Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-and-Create-Memojis"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-and-Create-Memojis" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up and Create Memojis?"></a>How to Set Up and Create Memojis?</h2><p>Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.</p>
<p>You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.</p>

After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.</p>
<p>Read this article to learn more about Animoji: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/new-Animoji.jpg"
                      alt="new-Animoj"
                ></p>
<p> When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio" >Animoji Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.</p>
<p>Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.</p>
<p>Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.</p>
<p><strong>The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features</strong></p>
<p>Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.</p>
<h4 id="Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App"><a href="#Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App" class="headerlink" title="Supermoji – The Emoji App"></a>Supermoji – The Emoji App</h4><p>A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721" >Facemoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545" >Emoji Face Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model.

<p> When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio" >Animoji Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.</p>
<p>Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.</p>
<p>Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.</p>

<p>Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.</p>
<p>First, let’s check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis-2"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis-2" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?"></a>What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?</h2><p>Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.</p>
<p>Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.</p>

All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.</p>
<p>You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.</p>

After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.</p>
<p><strong>The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features</strong></p>
<p>Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.</p>
<h4 id="Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App-3"><a href="#Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App-3" class="headerlink" title="Supermoji – The Emoji App"></a>Supermoji – The Emoji App</h4><p>A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721" >Facemoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545" >Emoji Face Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model.

<p>Gamers, YouTubers and all other Mac and PC users who’d like to add a smiley or any other emoji to a video should try processing their footage with the Filmora <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >video editor <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.

However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.</p>
<p>You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video.

It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.</p>

However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.</p>
<p>You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video.
