<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img

                      alt=" what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>

This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:</p>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img

                      alt=" what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-3"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img

                      alt=" what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-3"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>

This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:</p>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.</p>
<p>The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.</p>
<p>For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.</p>
<p>Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it’s right for you, but there is no commitment involved.</p>

<p>Additional details unique to your team and use case can also be entered in custom text fields. Then, using a PDF format, you can export your storyboard when you’re ready to pitch. Finally, stakeholders can review it using a private link without requiring an account in an alternative method.

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-5"><a href="#Conclusion-5" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>
<p>The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

Before you can capitalize on that amazing footage of triggered people you first have to make sure you have everything you need to generate a meme. Okay, let’s get started with the essentials to making a fun and effective meme.</p>
<h4 id="1-A-Triggered-Template"><a href="#1-A-Triggered-Template" class="headerlink" title="1. A Triggered Template"></a>1. A Triggered Template</h4><p> You have virtually unlimited resources at your disposal, as this meme template can be easily found through a quick Google search. There is even an Android app called <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.toukopeltomaa.triggeredgenerator&hl=en_US" >Triggered Meme Maker <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, that lets you do what its name suggests, make triggered memes. Making your own template in Microsoft Paint (we will show you how to make it in this article later) or any other photo editing software is also an option if you want to select the color of the background, rather than work with what you can find online.</p>
<h4 id="2-A-Video-Editing-Software"><a href="#2-A-Video-Editing-Software" class="headerlink" title="2. A Video Editing Software"></a>2. A Video Editing Software</h4><p> Memes are short videos that rarely last longer than 30 seconds, which is why you don’t need a powerful video editing suite like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere Pro to make a good meme. A software like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.</p>
<h4 id="3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme"><a href="#3-The-Sound-for-the-Triggered-Meme" class="headerlink" title="3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme"></a>3. The Sound for the Triggered Meme</h4><p> This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music and sounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint"><a href="#Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint" class="headerlink" title="Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint"></a>Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint</h2><p> Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.</p>
<p> Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-2"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-2" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Triggered Meme?"></a>How to Make a Triggered Meme?</h2><p> Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.</p>
<h4 id="1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project"><a href="#1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project" class="headerlink" title="1. Adding Media to a Project"></a>1. Adding Media to a Project</h4><p> Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.</p>
<h4 id="2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect"><a href="#2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the Green Screen Effect"></a>2. Using the Green Screen Effect</h4><p> Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.</p>
<h4 id="3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects"><a href="#3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects" class="headerlink" title="3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects"></a>3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects</h4><p> In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.</p>
<p> After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme"><a href="#4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme"></a>4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme</h4><p> Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.</p>
<p> Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.</p>
<h4 id="4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora"><a href="#4-Exporting-the-Triggered-Meme-from-Filmora" class="headerlink" title="4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora"></a>4. Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora</h4><p> When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.</p>
<p> The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p> The precious memories of your friends being enraged by the silliest things can be turned into hilarious memes effortlessly. A video editing software like Wondershare Filmora gives you all the tools you’ll need to quickly generate a triggered meme, so you can focus on having fun with your friends.

The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music and sounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>
<h2 id="Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint-1"><a href="#Making-a-Triggered-Meme-Template-in-Microsoft-Paint-1" class="headerlink" title="Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint"></a>Making a Triggered Meme Template in Microsoft Paint</h2><p> Creating a meme template is an easy task that can be handled from the Microsoft Paint in a couple of minutes. When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.</p>
<p> Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.</p>
<h2 id="How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-3"><a href="#How-to-Make-a-Triggered-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Make a Triggered Meme?"></a>How to Make a Triggered Meme?</h2><p> Once you’ve successfully created a triggered template you can move on to the next step of the meme making process.</p>
<h4 id="1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-1"><a href="#1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-1" class="headerlink" title="1. Adding Media to a Project"></a>1. Adding Media to a Project</h4><p> Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.</p>
<h4 id="2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1"><a href="#2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-1" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the Green Screen Effect"></a>2. Using the Green Screen Effect</h4><p> Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.</p>
<h4 id="3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-1"><a href="#3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-1" class="headerlink" title="3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects"></a>3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects</h4><p> In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.</p>
<p> After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-1"><a href="#4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-1" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme"></a>4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme</h4><p> Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.</p>
<p> Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.</p>

Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora</h4><p> When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.</p>
<p> The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.</p>

A software like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> that is easy to use and yet packed with cool visual effects and useful tools is a better choice if you just want to have a little fun with a video you recorded.</p>

The Sound for the Triggered Meme</h4><p> This ingredient of a good meme is easy to forget, but music or any other type of sound can make your meme funnier. In most cases, you’ll want to keep at least a portion of the original audio, but adding sound effects at different points of the meme can have a comical effect. The Filmora’s Music Library can serve as your endless source of <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >royalty free music and sounds <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>.</p>

When you launch the software, click on the Fill with color icon located in the Tools section of the Paint’s ribbon. Activating this option enables you to change the color of the background with a single click. Proceed to select the color of the background from the color palette located on the far right side of the ribbon. We recommend choosing shades of green because the background is going to be used for the Chroma Key effect. You can click on the Edit Colors icon if you want to find a perfect color tone for the background. Right-click anywhere on the canvas to change its color.</p>
<p> Now you just need to add the text to your template. Select the Text option in the Tools menu and then proceed to select the font or the size of your text in the Font menu. Make sure that the Opaque feature is enabled in the Background menu in order to change the color of the textbox background. Adjusting the Color 1 option in the Color Menu will enable you to choose the text color, while the Color 2 option lets you pick the color of the background. Type triggered in the textbox, and center the text by clicking on the TAB button on your keyboard a few times. Now you have everything you need to start creating your own triggered meme.</p>

<h4 id="1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-3"><a href="#1-Adding-Media-to-a-Project-3" class="headerlink" title="1. Adding Media to a Project"></a>1. Adding Media to a Project</h4><p> Open Filmora in the Full Feature Mode and import all the files you’re going to need during the process of making a meme. The files you import to your project will be stored in the Media Panel. Add the video to the timeline by dropping it over the video track. You can then remove the unwanted parts of the clip or add a still frame to the end of the video to prolong the triggered effect of the meme. Still frames in Filmora can be created by clicking on the Snapshot icon, that is located below the Preview Panel.</p>
<h4 id="2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3"><a href="#2-Using-the-Green-Screen-Effect-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Using the Green Screen Effect"></a>2. Using the Green Screen Effect</h4><p> Place the triggered template to the Picture-in-Picture track and try to position it at the exact place in the video where the person gets triggered. Click on the Green Screen icon located in the toolbar to gain access to the PIP Edit window. The Chroma Key (Green Screen) option will be selected by default, so you just have to check the ‘Make parts of the clip transparent’ box. The green background of the template will become transparent and you’ll be able to see parts of your video, with the triggered text displayed below it.</p>
<h4 id="3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-3"><a href="#3-Enhancing-Colors-and-Applying-Effects-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects"></a>3. Enhancing Colors and Applying Effects</h4><p> In order to highlight just how much a person in the video got triggered, you can change the vibrance and saturation in a portion of a video clip by clicking on the Edit icon in the toolbar. In addition, other software’s color correction tools like brightness, tint or contrast can also be used to highlight the triggered moment.</p>
<p> After you adjust the color values, you can click on the Effects icon if you want to add motion blur or camera shake effects. Click on the Shake option in the Effects panel to start browsing through different effects and click on the plus icon to add the effect to the clip you selected. The Distortion category in the Effects panel features a number of blur effects you can use to make the video more entertaining. You can adjust the properties of all the effects you add to your meme and control how much of the effect is applied to the video.</p>
<h4 id="4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-3"><a href="#4-Adding-Music-and-Text-Overlays-to-Your-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme"></a>4. Adding Music and Text Overlays to Your Meme</h4><p> Increasing the number of visual elements in the video can help you create a funnier meme. A single word can change the meaning of a meme so if you want to add additional comment besides noting that the person got triggered you can click on the Text icon and select the text overlay you like. Click on the plus icon that is displayed over the effect to add it to a video clip. A textbox will appear over the video in the Preview window and you can drag it around the screen to reposition it or rotate it. Enable the No Animation option if you want the text to just appear and disappear from the screen.</p>
<p> Sounds can add to the comical effect of a meme. Carefully select what type of music or sound you want to use for a meme since it can improve the quality of your meme. Simply drag the audio file you imported into Filmora and place it on the audio track and adjust its duration to match the duration of the video. If you don’t have your own music you can try some of the tracks featured in the software’s music library.</p>

Exporting the Triggered Meme from Filmora</h4><p> When your meme is ready to hit the social media, you can click on the Export button. In the Export window, you can choose any of the available file formats, but the formats best suited for memes are either MP4 or GIF. Click on the Settings icon in the Output Description menu to change the frame rate, resolution or the quality of the video. Wondershare Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube channel or your Facebook account, so you don’t have to waste time on posting the meme after the export process is completed.</p>
<p> The software also offers the option to save a meme you created to your hard drive if you don’t want to post a meme on social media right away. You just have to click on the Export button after adjusting the output settings and wait for the file to be exported.</p>

<p> Have you ever been so confused that you thought that a butterfly is a pigeon? Apparently, the main protagonist of <em>The Brave Fighter of Sun Fighbird</em> from the Japanese anime TV series has. In an episode that was released in January 1991, Yutaro Katori seriously asked ‘<em>is this a pigeon</em>?’ while looking at a butterfly. At first, everyone thought that it was just a poor translation, but it turned out that the translation was correct, which turned this still frame into a meme as early as 2011.</p>
<p> After a while, the Is This a Pigeon meme came out of fashion, but at the beginning of 2018, it went viral again. Today the meme is used to express all sorts of confusing opinions, that range from popular culture references to philosophical questions. If you’re utterly confused in certain situations or if you simply like making Is This a Pigeon meme, you’re at the right place because in this article we’re going to show you how you can generate these memes in a couple of simple steps.</p>
