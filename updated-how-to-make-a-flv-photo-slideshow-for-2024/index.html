<p> <strong>How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?</strong></p>
<p>Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"

<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"
                      alt="export slideshow with travel photos"

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img

                      alt="what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>

This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:</p>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg"
                      alt="what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Where-to-Find-the-Meaning-of-Emojis-1"><a href="#Part-3-Where-to-Find-the-Meaning-of-Emojis-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?"></a>Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?</h2><p>Once you have understood <strong>what emoji is</strong>, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:</p>

<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>

<h4 id="How-to-Find-Emojis-on-Windows-8-and-Windows-10-3"><a href="#How-to-Find-Emojis-on-Windows-8-and-Windows-10-3" class="headerlink" title="How to Find Emojis on Windows 8 and Windows 10"></a>How to Find Emojis on Windows 8 and Windows 10</h4><p>On Windows 8 or Windows 10 computers, click the ‘Keyboard’ icon that is present in the ‘Notification area’ at the bottom-right corner of the screen, i.e. right side of the taskbar. When the list of emojis appears, you can click your favorite one and use it in the messenger.</p>

                      alt="Emoji type: Smiley people"
                ></p>
<p>Some of the most commonly used categories that you must know after understanding <strong>what is an emoji</strong> include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Smileys &amp; People</strong> – Holds the images of faces reflecting facial expressions and the vector images&#x2F;animations of some popular people</li>
<li><strong>Animals &amp; Nature</strong> – Contains the images&#x2F;animations of animals and other natural elements such as trees, rocks, mountains, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Food &amp; Drink</strong> – This category has vector images of beautifully decorated and well-aligned wine glasses, soft drink cans, pizza slices, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Activity</strong> – Has the emojis that reflect certain actions such as dance stances, walking, running, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Travel &amp; Places</strong> – Is equipped with vectors of transportation mediums and locations such as trains, buses, buildings, banks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Objects</strong> – Is populated with miscellaneous objects like a pair of shoes, suits, clocks, socks, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong> – This one consists of different types of symbols such as an equal to sign, stop sign, delta symbol, and many more</li>
<li><strong>Flags</strong> – This category contains flags of almost all the countries of the world. These emojis are mostly used to illustrate your current or destination location for reference</li>
</ul>

However, using too many of them in your conversation might make the entire text look overly populated, and your communication partner may lose interest in you. Therefore, understanding when and how to use emojis is as important as it is to know <strong>what the emoji means.</strong></p>
