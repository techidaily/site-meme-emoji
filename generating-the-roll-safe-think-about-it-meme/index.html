<p> Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we’ve all made more foolish assumptions than we’d care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they’ve become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the <em>Hood Documentary</em> series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: ‘<em>You can’t be broke if you don’t check your bank account’</em> went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.</p>
<p> Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we’re going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme</h2><p> Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you’d like to achieve.</p>

<p><em>Can’t lose</em> <em>if you don’t play</em> is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don’t try something you can’t fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it’s not, and that’s the catch.</p>

<p> A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren’t in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you’ll never be in a relationship.</p>

<p> We all complain about financial troubles in one way or the other, and Roll Safe-Think About It offers a pretty funny way to do that. Once again, a seemingly valid point that only looks good in theory is the punch-line of the meme. There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.</p>

Once again, a seemingly valid point that only looks good in theory is the punch-line of the meme. There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.</p>

<p> Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we’ve all made more foolish assumptions than we’d care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they’ve become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the <em>Hood Documentary</em> series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: ‘<em>You can’t be broke if you don’t check your bank account’</em> went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.</p>
<p> Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we’re going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme-3"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme</h2><p> Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you’d like to achieve.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><em>Can’t lose</em> <em>if you don’t play</em> is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don’t try something you can’t fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it’s not, and that’s the catch.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p> A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren’t in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you’ll never be in a relationship.</p>

Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, you can use the same menu as Windows and Mac to upload emoji.</p>
<p>Discord’s interface is similar across all devices, so the following steps work on Android and Apple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.</li>
</ul>

<li>To get to your server settings, press “Settings” in the Discord server menu that shows up.</li>
<li>Under the “Server Settings” menu, select “Emoji” to access the custom emoji settings.</li>

<li>Press “Upload Emoji” to upload any emoji that aligns with these requirements</li>
<li>Press the custom emoji file, tap “Crop” if it needs cropping, and then use the “Upload” option</li>
<li>After you upload the emoji file, replace the alias tag by tapping on it. This will redirect you to that specific emoji’s settings</li>
<li>Type the name you want using the “Alias” box to create the tag used to insert emoji in messages</li>
<li>Save this new tag with the “Save” icon placed in the bottom right</li>
<li>Any changes you make to the custom emoji’s alias are applied to it instantly for your use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emoji bring fun to the conversations you have with friends, and it is very easy to add them to your server as well. These show up in the emoji pop-up list once you add them. The chat message bar contains the emoji icon from where you can access them.</p>
<p>It is essential to name your emoji with only alphanumeric characters and underscores using at least two characters.</p>
<p>The Discord emoji size is 32x32 pixels, so even if you upload up to 128x128 pixel size emojis, they will be resized to the default dimensions. Furthermore, emoji file sizes are at most 256kb.</p>
<p>If you want to use custom emojis, you can’t do so without a Nitro subscription because it is only functional on the server they are uploaded to. Even if you find a way to access the emoji from some other server, only its text code will be visible.</p>
<p>If you attempt to use the Emoji Picker to pick an emoji, you’ll get the following message:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Open Roles:</strong> Open the Server Settings and select “Roles” from the menu on the side.</li>
<li><strong>Toggle Manage Emoji:</strong> Pick the role you want to apply the permission to, and then toggle emoji’s slider to “on,” save changes, and you’re done!</li>

<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>
