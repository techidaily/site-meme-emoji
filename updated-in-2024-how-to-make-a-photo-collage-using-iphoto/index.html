<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening “Shared Album”.

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>

<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-3"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme</h2><p>Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won’t necessarily make this meme as effective as you’d like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.</p>
<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

<p>The elements of the Nut meme are always the same, although their topics can vary because the hand and the blue button are irreplaceable parts of this meme.</p>

<p> Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he&#x2F;she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video"><a href="#How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video" class="headerlink" title="How to make the baby’s first year video"></a>How to make the baby’s first year video</h2><p><strong>Filming tips</strong></p>
<p> Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize the camera</strong> - The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong> - You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong> - Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> - Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing tips</strong></p>
<p> Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.</p>

With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>

A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) or <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>.</strong> (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>)</strong> (right brace) will create a smiley face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>(</strong> (left brace) will create a sad face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) will create a wink face</p>

<p>In Windows 11, although you can launch the emojis keyboard using the same shortcuts, i.e., ‘Windows + .’ or ‘Windows + ;’ keys as mentioned earlier, the emojis keyboard itself has four sections, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emojis</strong> – Contains various emojis and smileys</li>
<li><strong>GIF</strong> – Gives you access to various animated GIFs from Tenor</li>
<li><strong>Kamojis</strong> – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong> – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While the emojis were introduced to Windows as late as 2012, Windows 11 has a wide range of these virtual objects or faces for various occasions and to convey different expressions respectively. Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.</p>
<p>Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.iemoji.com/" >http://www.iemoji.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and using the options that the website offers.

With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) or <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>.</strong> (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.</p>
<p>As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>)</strong> (right brace) will create a smiley face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>(</strong> (left brace) will create a sad face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) will create a wink face</p>
<p>…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:</p>
