<p><strong>How to edit the honeymoon video with Wondershare Filmora</strong></p>
<p>All you have to do is to go through the next steps:</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Import your honeymoon photos and videos</p>
<p>Gather all the videos and images that you have from your honeymoon then paste them inside the app.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-videos.jpg"
                      alt="import video"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Tone your videos with editing tools</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/basic-editing-tool.png"

                      alt="music"
                ></p>
<p>Once you have that, add the music from the integrated royalty free library to ignite your love story.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Save and share you video</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
