<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>
<p><img

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Photo-Collage-in-iPhoto-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Photo-Collage-in-iPhoto-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?</h2><p>Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG"
                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-drag-photo.JPG"
                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>
</ol>

However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.</p>

With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more. By selecting a title from the genre category like horror, lifestyle, or even stand-up comedy, users can easily find and watch movie online.

An option of Add To My Playlist further makes this SolarMovie alternative an excellent site.</p>

All the movie titles contain a rating that helps the user decide whether that movie is worth their time or not. The video player in this SolarMovie alternative features the fast-forward and rewind option too. The only downside is that it has a few annoying pop-up ads.</p>

<p> Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he&#x2F;she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:</p>

<p> Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize the camera</strong> - The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong> - You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong> - Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> - Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing tips</strong></p>
<p> Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.</p>
