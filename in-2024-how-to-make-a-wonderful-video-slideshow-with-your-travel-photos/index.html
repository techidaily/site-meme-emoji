<p> <strong>How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?</strong></p>
<p>Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"
                      alt="export slideshow with travel photos "
                ></p>

<p>Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.</p>

<p> <strong>How can you create video slideshows with Wondershare Filmora?</strong></p>
<p>Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"

<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word.

<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>

<p>Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.</p>
<p>First, let’s check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?"></a>What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?</h2><p>Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.</p>
<p>Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.</p>

<h2 id="How-to-Set-Up-and-Create-Memojis"><a href="#How-to-Set-Up-and-Create-Memojis" class="headerlink" title="How to Set Up and Create Memojis?"></a>How to Set Up and Create Memojis?</h2><p>Owners of iPhone X, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max, and iPadPro can easily make new memojis from their devices. All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.</p>
<p>You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.</p>

After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.</p>
<p>Read this article to learn more about Animoji: <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >The Ultimate Guide of How to Use Animoji on iPhone X. <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="new-Animoj"
                ></p>
<p> When you’re ready, launch the iMessage app and choose an animoji or memoji character you’re going to be in the video. Don’t record karaoke videos in the full-screen mode because the record button is going to cover a significant portion of the screen, which can complicate the video editing process. Optionally, you download and install the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://github.com/insidegui/AnimojiStudio" >Animoji Studio <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> app if you want to record videos that are longer than thirty seconds, but you might need some time to get used to making karaoke videos with this app.</p>
<p>Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.</p>
<p>Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.</p>
<p><strong>The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features</strong></p>
<p>Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.</p>

Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721" >Facemoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545" >Emoji Face Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model.

<p>Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.</p>
<p>Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.</p>

<p>Becoming a superstar whose music is adored in every corner of the Earth is not something that can be achieved overnight. The rest of us, who only dream of worldwide fame can just enjoy our favorite songs and from time to time create animoji karaoke music videos for entertainment purposes. Read on if you are not sure what animojis are and how you can use them to create music videos from your iPhone or iPad, because in this article we are going to take you through each step of the process of making an animoji karaoke video.</p>
<p>First, let’s check some popular Memoji Karaoke video from YouTube. The Video below is from YouTuber Memoji Karaoke, enjoy.</p>
<h2 id="What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis-2"><a href="#What-Exactly-is-The-Difference-Between-Animojis-and-Memojis-2" class="headerlink" title="What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?"></a>What Exactly is The Difference Between Animojis and Memojis?</h2><p>Animojis and Memojis have taken the world by storm since the first iPhone X model was released back in 2017. Both animojis and memojis utilize facial recognition technologies to track your movements and facial expressions and imitate them in a virtual environment. However, an animoji is a 3D emoji like a monkey, koala, tiger or a unicorn, while memojis are fully customizable avatars that let you create a character from scratch.</p>
<p>Memojis enable you to choose the character’s skin color, head, nose, ear shape or hairstyle, meaning that you can create as many new characters as you want effortlessly. Furthermore, you can add stickers or apply up to five different filters to animojis and memojis you share with your friends.</p>

All you have to do in order to start creating a new memoji is open the messaging app, locate the iMessage AppStore icon, tap on it and then tap on the Animoji icon. By doing so you will gain access to all animojis that are available on iOS 12 or other versions of the iOS that support memojis and animojis. After tapping on the New Memoji icon you will be able to see the default character you can customize as you see fit.</p>
<p>You can now get creative and pick one of the countless skin tones, choose how old your character is going to be or select any of the available head, nose and ear shapes. Moreover, you can customize the eye color for each character you create, add eyewear, or decide whether or not your character is going to have facial hair. Once you’re finished customizing a new memoji, simply tap on the Done button and the character you’ve created is going to be saved in your animoji collection. You can edit, duplicate or delete the memojis by tapping on the three dot icon or you can use them as camera overlays and share them with your friends.</p>

After the recording session is completed, you can review the material you’ve produced, and decide if you are happy with the result or if you want to do another take. The only downside is that you can’t play music from your iPhone or your iPad while you’re recording, which means that you have to play the song you want to cover from another device such as a computer or the stereo system.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that knowing the lyrics of the song is going to improve the quality of the karaoke music video you’re producing significantly, so rehearsing a song few times before you hit the record button may be a good idea if you don’t know its lyrics by heart.</p>

<p>Proceed to record your 30-second video or activate the Screen Recording option from the Control Center if you want to capture a karaoke video that exceeds that limit. If you like the results you can simply send the video you’ve created as a message, but you can also transfer the file to your computer and edit from a video editing software like Filmora.</p>
<p>Import the memoji video file you’ve transferred to your computer into Filmora after you’ve created a new project. You can do this from the software’s Media panel by clicking on the Import drop-down menu and choosing the Import Media Files option. Place the video file on the timeline and then cut or trim all parts of the clip you don’t want to include in the final cut of your memoji karaoke video. Filmora offers a vast number of different opening titles, end credits, audio and visual effects and transitions that can all help you create a visually attractive karaoke video.</p>
<p>Moreover, you can duplicate an animoji or memoji and create a duet in just a few simple clicks. The editor’s powerful audio editing tools enable you to add a high-quality audio file to your project or sound effects that can make your video more entertaining. Click on the Export button to choose the output destination, format, resolution and aspect ratio for the karaoke video you’ve just created. Filmora lets you export videos directly to your YouTube or Vimeo channel, which can be quite handy if you want to share your memoji videos online immediately after you’ve completed the video editing process.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Face ID feature, as well as animojis and memojis, are relatively novel additions on iOS-based devices, and you won’t be able to create memoji or animoji karaoke videos from the iMessages app unless you have one of the following iPhone or iPad models.</p>
<p><strong>The list of iPhone and iPad models that offer the Face ID, Animoji and Memoji Features</strong></p>
<p>Older models of iPhones, iPods, and iPads that have the latest version of iOS installed can only receive animoji and memoji messages, but it is not possible to create these messages with them. In case you are using an older model of an iPhone or an iPad but you still want to create animoji and memoji karaoke videos you can find a simple solution to your problem below.</p>
<h4 id="Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App-–-The-Best-App-for-Creation-of-Animoji-and-Memoji-Music-Videos-on-Old-Versions-of-iPhones-and-iPads-3"><a href="#Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App-–-The-Best-App-for-Creation-of-Animoji-and-Memoji-Music-Videos-on-Old-Versions-of-iPhones-and-iPads-3" class="headerlink" title="Supermoji – The Emoji App – The Best App for Creation of Animoji and Memoji Music Videos on Old Versions of iPhones and iPads"></a><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/supermoji-the-emoji-app/id1300364926" >Supermoji – The Emoji App <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> – The Best App for Creation of Animoji and Memoji Music Videos on Old Versions of iPhones and iPads</h4><p>A powerful and intuitive app like Supermoji enables you to create karaoke music videos that feature your favorite animoji and memoji characters with ease. Creating animated 3D models won’t take too much of your time if you choose to download and install this app on your device, but after a three-day trial period, you’ll have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription costs $9.99, while you must pay $29.99 for a monthly subscription, which makes the Supermoji app a bit pricy. Alternatively, you can try <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/facemoji/id1418685721" >Facemoji <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545" >Emoji Face Recorder <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> apps, but the results you’ll get can be a bit underwhelming when compared to the animojis and memojis created from the iMessages app.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>Creating funny animoji and memoji karaoke music videos is a new trend that can only grow in popularity in the future. However, this feature is only available on recent iPhone and iPad models, but there are a number of third-party apps that enable you to create this type of video even if you are using an older iPhone or iPad model.

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>

<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>

<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>

<p> Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he&#x2F;she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video"><a href="#How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video" class="headerlink" title="How to make the baby’s first year video"></a>How to make the baby’s first year video</h2><p><strong>Filming tips</strong></p>
<p> Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize the camera</strong> - The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong> - You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong> - Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> - Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing tips</strong></p>
<p> Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.</p>

<p><strong>Adjust saturation</strong> - You should try to use the app in order to adjust the saturation as this can lead to some very bad results if you’re not careful. Find the proper saturation levels and opt for them right away.</p>
<p><strong>Trim, cut, or split</strong> - If needed, split, cut or even trim the video. There will be times when you will need the reversing effect as well. All of these effects are accessible via the Wondershare Filmora video app.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced editing</strong> - Plus, you will also need to apply a green screen effect as this will help you place your baby in a variety of funny locations, be it a funny MV or a Hollywood movie. The app can also help you clone the baby with PIP effects and you can also use it to add filters, overlays or text.</p>
<p> Wondershare Filmora will offer you an extraordinary set of tools and it will bring in front a very good value right from the start. The interface of the app is user friendly and you will have no problem using it as you see fit. Also, you can create the baby’s first year video on both Mac and Windows as the app supports both platforms. It also delivers immediate support for camcorders and smartphones so you can use any device you want for video capture. With its help you can share videos to DVD or YouTube too if you so desire. Don’t hesitate and access this great tool as fast as possible to get a good outcome!</p>

<p> Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he&#x2F;she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video-2"><a href="#How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video-2" class="headerlink" title="How to make the baby’s first year video"></a>How to make the baby’s first year video</h2><p><strong>Filming tips</strong></p>
<p> Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize the camera</strong> - The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong> - You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong> - Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> - Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing tips</strong></p>
<p> Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.</p>
