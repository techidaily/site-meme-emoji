It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.</p>
<p>The funniest subreddits on &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read “Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there’s nobody else there.”&#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as “there’s someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead.”</p>

There’s no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.</p>
<p>For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.</p>

To start with, users usually share internet culture pieces.</p>
<p>You won’t find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, “Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don’t be said. I’ll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you.” Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.</p>

The photoshop memes or image macros series related to Star War films content is all about r&#x2F;PrequelMemes. It helps to change the audience’s opinion about the movie.</p>
<p>For instance, when the star war movie is about to start at 7.45 and at 7.40 you reach and your dad is still left to carry your baby brother from his car seat. You see a character from the movie asking you to leave him or else you cannot make it in time for the movie.</p>

Not in the cage but laughing at you.” Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.</p>

Let’s say someone compliments you on a chat app; you can use a smiley emoji to tell that you are happy. At the same time, an angry emoji lets you express that you are angry.</p>
<p>Apart from the generic emojis that you can find in your chat applications, Bitmoji enables you to customize your character and share it with people you chat with. Bitmoji is fun, but do you know how to add it to a keyboard? If you don’t, don’t worry, this post will help you understand how to do that.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Bitmoji"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Bitmoji" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Bitmoji?"></a>Part 1: What is Bitmoji?</h2><p>If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.</p>
<p>Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.</p>

                      alt="create bitmoji mobile"
                ></p>
<p>Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-and-Use-Bitmoji-to-iPhone-Keyboard"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-and-Use-Bitmoji-to-iPhone-Keyboard" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?"></a>Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?</h2><p>Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="iphone keyboard option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="iphone keyboard bitmoji option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, toggle the option that says Allow Full Access. Once you do that, you will see a small pop-up. Click on the Allow option.</p>
<p>And that’s it. Bitmoji will be added to the iPhone keyboard. Open any messaging app and click on the globe and hold it for a few seconds. When you see Bitmoji, click on that, and you will be able to use Bitmoji stickers.</p>

Before you begin to use it, go through the first part again and download the app. Then create your Bitmoji, as explained earlier.

Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.</p>
<p>Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.</p>

<p>Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.</p>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>

<p>All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis. Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.</p>

<h2 id="Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Create-Animoji-or-Memoji-Videos"><a href="#Best-Apps-You-Can-Use-to-Create-Animoji-or-Memoji-Videos" class="headerlink" title="Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos"></a>Best Apps You Can Use to Create Animoji or Memoji Videos</h2><p>Even though recording thirty-second animoji and memoji videos with iPhone X, iPhone XS or iPad Pro is a quick and simple process, the time limit is still a huge obstacle to social media content creators who want to create animoji and memoji videos that surpass that limit. Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.</p>
<h4 id="1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces"><a href="#1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces" class="headerlink" title="1. Emoji Me Animated Faces"></a>1. Emoji Me Animated Faces</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.</p>
<h4 id="2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder"><a href="#2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. EMOJI Face Recorder"></a>2. EMOJI Face Recorder</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Android</p>
<p>You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.</p>
<h4 id="3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar"><a href="#3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar" class="headerlink" title="3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar"></a>3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes. The app lets you customize all of your facial features, and pick the shape of your nose, the color of your eyes or the accessories you want to add to the fictional character you’re creating. Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.</p>
<h4 id="4-Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App"><a href="#4-Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App" class="headerlink" title="4. Supermoji – The Emoji App"></a>4. Supermoji – The Emoji App</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>

                      alt="what-is-emoji"
                ></p>
<p>This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>
<h4 id="5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters"><a href="#5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters" class="headerlink" title="5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters"></a>5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/mrrmrr-faceapp-face-filters/id1102411061" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Android</p>
<p>Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>
<h4 id="6-MSQRD"><a href="#6-MSQRD" class="headerlink" title="6. MSQRD"></a>6. MSQRD</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung AR Emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Samsung Galaxy series.</p>
<p>Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

<p>Animoji and memoji videos have become one of the hottest trends on social media in a relatively short period of time.

<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device.

Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.</p>

<p>You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos.

<p>This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>

The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>
<h4 id="6-MSQRD-1"><a href="#6-MSQRD-1" class="headerlink" title="6. MSQRD"></a>6. MSQRD</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung AR Emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Samsung Galaxy series.</p>
<p>Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

                ></p>
<p>This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>

<p>Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>
<h4 id="6-MSQRD-3"><a href="#6-MSQRD-3" class="headerlink" title="6. MSQRD"></a>6. MSQRD</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>

<p>MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung AR Emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Samsung Galaxy series.</p>
<p>Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>

                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>

Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="PhotoGrid Background"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>
