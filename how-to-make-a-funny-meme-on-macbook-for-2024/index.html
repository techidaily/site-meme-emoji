<h2 id="Ingredients-to-Make-an-Effective-Meme"><a href="#Ingredients-to-Make-an-Effective-Meme" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme"></a>Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme</h2><p>Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion"><a href="#Conclusion" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >FilmoraX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the job becomes even easier.</p>

Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.</p>

<h2 id="Ingredients-to-Make-an-Effective-Meme-3"><a href="#Ingredients-to-Make-an-Effective-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme"></a>Ingredients to Make an Effective Meme</h2><p>Memes keep gaining far-reaching traction. Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-3"><a href="#Conclusion-3" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a>Conclusion</h4><p>Memes can be of different types but what matters the most is they make the viewers laugh. If you keep the above tips in mind, you will be able to make a meme successfully. By using a meme maker like <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >FilmoraX <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, the job becomes even easier.</p>

<p>Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.</p>
<p>So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.</p>
<h2 id="10-Funniest-Subreddits-to-Find-Memes"><a href="#10-Funniest-Subreddits-to-Find-Memes" class="headerlink" title="10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes"></a>10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes</h2><h3 id="1-r-AdviceAnimals"><a href="#1-r-AdviceAnimals" class="headerlink" title="1. &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals"></a>1. &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals</h3><p>On 7th December 2010, the &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.</p>
<p>The funniest subreddits on &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read “Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there’s nobody else there.”&#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as “there’s someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead.”</p>

There’s no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.</p>
<p>For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.</p>

<p>You won’t find any macro images or animal advice memes, ironical jokes allowed, poor titles and reposts, no harassment, or meta-posts. So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, “Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don’t be said. I’ll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you.” Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.</p>

Not in the cage but laughing at you.” Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.</p>

With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>

A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) or <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>.</strong> (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.</p>
<p>As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>)</strong> (right brace) will create a smiley face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>(</strong> (left brace) will create a sad face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) will create a wink face</p>
<p>…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:</p>

<p>In Windows 11, although you can launch the emojis keyboard using the same shortcuts, i.e., ‘Windows + .’ or ‘Windows + ;’ keys as mentioned earlier, the emojis keyboard itself has four sections, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emojis</strong> – Contains various emojis and smileys</li>
<li><strong>GIF</strong> – Gives you access to various animated GIFs from Tenor</li>
<li><strong>Kamojis</strong> – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong> – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.</p>
<h2 id="Part-5-How-to-Get-More-Emojis-in-Windows-11-3"><a href="#Part-5-How-to-Get-More-Emojis-in-Windows-11-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 5: How to Get More Emojis in Windows 11"></a>Part 5: How to Get More Emojis in Windows 11</h2><p>If the built-in emoji library doesn’t contain your favorite expressions, you can always get several more by following the instructions given below:</p>
<ul>
<li>Launch your favorite web browser on Windows 11, and then go to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.iemoji.com/" >http://www.iemoji.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></li>
<li>Click an emoji from the available options or copy one from your favorite portal, and paste it in the <strong>Paste Emoji here</strong> field</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/select-emoji-from-iemoji-windows.jpg"
                      alt="select emoji from iemoji windows"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Review the emoji in the <strong>MESSAGE PREVIEW</strong> field, and click <strong>Create</strong> from the <strong>Options</strong> section to generate the emoji that can be sent as a message or image</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/create-emojis-on-windows-iemoji.jpg"
                      alt="create emojis on windows iemoji"
                ></p>
<ul>
<li>Alternatively, click <strong>Copy</strong> from the <strong>Options</strong> section itself, and then go to the text editor or any other portal you want to use the emoji in, and press Ctrl + V to paste and insert the emoji in your conversation or text without any hassle.</li>
</ul>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/copy-emojis-on-iemoji.jpg"
                      alt="copy emojis on iemoji"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While the emojis were introduced to Windows as late as 2012, Windows 11 has a wide range of these virtual objects or faces for various occasions and to convey different expressions respectively. Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.</p>
<p>Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.iemoji.com/" >http://www.iemoji.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and using the options that the website offers. All in all, it’s easy to learn <strong>how to use emojis on Windows</strong> as long as you have access to the correct tutorial that explains the process in an easy manner.</p>
