So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.</p>
<p>Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-What-is-Bitmoji-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-is-Bitmoji-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What is Bitmoji?"></a>Part 1: What is Bitmoji?</h2><p>If you are new to Bitmoji, you may wonder what it is? Bitmoji is essentially your own personal emoji. You can create a cartoon version of yourself and share it with people to make the conversation fun. So, what one does is create an avatar of themselves and give it all kinds of expressions.</p>
<p>Then, you can create comics using your Bitmoji, use it to express yourself while having a chat, and even use it as a reaction. Anyone who is done using the same old emojis has started using Bitmoji because it’s a lot more fun.</p>
<p>Now, let’s learn how to create your very own Bitmoji.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> First, go to the App Store or Play store and download the Bitmoji application.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Once downloaded, launch the app and start making an avatar or your Bitmoji.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Pick a skin color, hair color, chin, nose, hairstyle, jawline, and more.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="create bitmoji mobile"
                ></p>
<p>Once your Bitmoji is created, you are all set to use the Bitmoji as stickers. Moreover, the app lets you dress your Bitmoji as you want as well. Let it have different expressions and postures because that’s how it’s going to be fun! After your Bitmoji is added, the next thing to do is enable Bitmoji on the keyboard of the device you are using.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Add-and-Use-Bitmoji-to-iPhone-Keyboard-2"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Add-and-Use-Bitmoji-to-iPhone-Keyboard-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?"></a>Part 2: How to Add and Use Bitmoji to iPhone Keyboard?</h2><p>Since you have learned how to create a Bimoji, it’s time to learn the steps to use it on your iPhone keyboard. Unfortunately, just by downloading the app, it won’t reflect on the keyboard directly. Instead, you will have to follow a few steps to add Bitmoji to the keyboard. Here’s what you need to do.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch your iPhone and click on the Settings option.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, go to the General option and click on the Keyboard option.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-option.jpg"
                      alt="iphone keyboard option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> When the Keyboard page opens, click on the option that says Keyboards and then click on Add New Keyboard.</p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> You will see the Third Party Keyboards option. There, you need to click on Bitmoji.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphone-keyboard-bitmoji-option.jpg"
                      alt="iphone keyboard bitmoji option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Now, toggle the option that says Allow Full Access. Once you do that, you will see a small pop-up. Click on the Allow option.</p>
<p>And that’s it. Bitmoji will be added to the iPhone keyboard. Open any messaging app and click on the globe and hold it for a few seconds. When you see Bitmoji, click on that, and you will be able to use Bitmoji stickers.</p>

Before you begin to use it, go through the first part again and download the app. Then create your Bitmoji, as explained earlier. You can send Bitmojis directly from the app itself, but if you plan to use Bitmoji regularly, getting the Bitmoji keyboard makes sense. So, once you are done, follow the following steps to get the Bitmoji keyboard on Android.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch the Bitmoji app. Click on the Keyboard option that you see at the bottom of the Bitmoji app screen.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="android phone keyboard option"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step</strong> <strong>2:</strong> Install Bitmoji keyboard and give permission to your phone to use Bitmoji keyboard. Bitmoji will notify you when the Bitmoji keyboard gets activated.</p>
<p><img

                      alt="enable bitmoji android"
                ></p>
<p>You are all done. Now, use the Bitmoji keyboard to chat with your family members and friends and make everything fun and exciting.</p>

If you already have the Google Chrome browser, carry on with the steps explained below; otherwise, get the browser before starting.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Go to Chrome Extension and install Bitmoji for Chrome Extension.</p>
<p><img

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme</h2><p>Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won’t necessarily make this meme as effective as you’d like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.</p>
<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

<p><strong>Generating the Nut Button Meme</strong></p>
<p>The Nut Button meme started out as an immature joke, with a word ‘Nut’ written across a blue button, and for a number of years, this meme was used mostly for bad sex jokes. However, the meme has evolved through the years and meme makers from around the world use it to make social media, gaming and countless other types of jokes.</p>
<p>Commonly, the Nut Button meme suggests that a person, in many cases the creator of the meme, likes doing something in certain types of situations, like listening to crappy music when they feel down or taking revenge on their enemies when they have the opportunity. Generating this type of meme doesn’t require too much effort as it often contains one word. Some versions of this meme include the motive that prompts the hand in the meme to push the button, but using this element of the meme is optional.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-1"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Nut-Button-Meme-1" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Nut Button Meme</h2><p>Taking the first concept that comes to your mind won’t necessarily make this meme as effective as you’d like it to be, so you have to think carefully which button the hand is going to hit.</p>
<p>Hitting the Divorce button can be a painful process in real life, but it can also be an endless source of fun if the reason why the hand hits it is so ridiculous that it could never be an actual reason for a divorce.</p>
<p>This meme can also be used to make fun of world leaders and their bad decisions or pop-culture figures that often do ill-advised things.</p>

In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.</p>
<h3 id="The-significant-elements-are"><a href="#The-significant-elements-are" class="headerlink" title="The significant elements are:"></a><strong>The significant elements are:</strong></h3><ul>
<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.</p>

<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img

                      alt="what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Where-to-Find-the-Meaning-of-Emojis"><a href="#Part-3-Where-to-Find-the-Meaning-of-Emojis" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?"></a>Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?</h2><p>Once you have understood <strong>what emoji is</strong>, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.</p>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>
<h2 id="Part-3-Where-to-Find-the-Meaning-of-Emojis-1"><a href="#Part-3-Where-to-Find-the-Meaning-of-Emojis-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?"></a>Part 3: Where to Find the Meaning of Emojis?</h2><p>Once you have understood <strong>what emoji is</strong>, it is now time to learn what the emojis mean. This part is imperative to ensure you don’t send a wrong emotional expression to your friends or family members, and get into some awkward situation after that.</p>
<p>Below is a list of some useful online websites and dictionaries that can help you find correct emojis along with their meanings to make your text conversation more meaningful and interesting:</p>

<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>

<p>The new page also has a ‘Copy’ button that can be used to copy the object to the clipboard, and then the element can be pasted onto any compatible messenger during a text conversation.</p>

<p>So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.</p>

It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.</p>
<p>The funniest subreddits on &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read “Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there’s nobody else there.”&#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as “there’s someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead.”</p>

There’s no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.</p>
<p>For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.</p>

So, the simple yet funniest memes show a poem with various minion expressions, “Roses are red, violets are blue. The face like yours belongs to the zoo. Don’t be said. I’ll be there too. Not in the cage but laughing at you.” Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.</p>

<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

<p>If you’re running an old macOS version and having iPhoto installed on your Mac, here are the detailed steps about How to make slideshow in iMovie with iPhoto project.</p>
<h4 id="Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-2"><a href="#Step-1-Import-Photos-from-the-iPhoto-Library-2" class="headerlink" title="Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library"></a>Step 1. Import Photos from the iPhoto Library</h4><p>iMovie works seamlessly with iPhoto. You are suggested to drag and drop photos from iPhoto to the iMovie project. If no library exists in iPhoto, create one and import photos to iPhoto first. To add videos, you could go to either “File&#x2F;Import” or Event Library, and then drag and drop selected videos to the timeline.</p>
<p>After photos and videos are imported to the iMovie slideshow project, you can preview the raw slideshow simply by pressing Space bar on your keyboard. And then make adjustments to clips and transitions. For example, mouse over one clip or “double arrow” button and click on the settings icon, then you could access clip adjustment, video adjustment, transition adjustment, etc.</p>

Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project"></a>Step 2. Add Music to Your iMovie Slideshow Project</h4><p>Music sets the tone of your slideshow. Adding musing to the iMovie slideshow is just as simple as adding photos and videos.</p>
<p>So click the audio icon in the bottom right corner, and drag and drop the desired audio file to the timeline. Multiple songs could be added to iMovie.</p>
<p>However, iMovie doesn’t support multiple soundtracks. If necessary, you need to combine multiple song tracks with an external audio editor before importing them to the iMovie slideshow. You can also apply audio effects and filter sound using an equalizer.</p>

Export Your iMovie Slideshow Video</h4><p>iMovie makes sharing possibilities endless. For those who upload their videos online, iMovie allows users to directly upload to MobileMe Gallery, YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, CNN iReport, etc.</p>
<p>If you select to share the iMovie slideshow using Media Browser, you will get a slideshow appeared in other Mac applications like iWeb. It’s a good idea to export the iMovie slideshow to iTunes so that you can play back slideshow quickly and easily sync with your mobile devices like iPhone, iPod, and iPad.</p>
