<h3 id="2-Tubi-TV"><a href="#2-Tubi-TV" class="headerlink" title="2. Tubi TV"></a>2. Tubi TV</h3><p>Tubi TV is a top-notch SolarMovie alternative site. With a sleek and attractive interface, Tubi TV features a wide variety of movies available for free streaming. Also, the movies are classified into various sections based on Popularity, Genre, and many more. By selecting a title from the genre category like horror, lifestyle, or even stand-up comedy, users can easily find and watch movie online.

<h3 id="5-Amazon-Prime"><a href="#5-Amazon-Prime" class="headerlink" title="5. Amazon Prime"></a>5. Amazon Prime</h3><p>Amazon Prime is yet another top-notch SolarMovie alternative.

                ></p>
<h3 id="6-Hulu"><a href="#6-Hulu" class="headerlink" title="6. Hulu"></a>6. Hulu</h3><p>Like SolarMovie, Hulu also boasts an extensive movie library. This library by Hulu is a mix of popular and classic movies. Also, it features a variety of Hulu original series and movies that you cannot find elsewhere.

Because Windows 10 offers a great range of emojis that help you express your feelings and reactions in fewer words, they have recently gained a decent level of popularity, mostly amongst youngsters and millennials.</p>
<p>With that said, in the following sections, you will learn <strong>how to use emojis on Windows 10</strong> using both keyboard shortcuts and touch keyboard, <strong>how to get emojis on Windows 10</strong> to make your text or conversation look more versatile, and what new has been added to the latest operating system released by Microsoft, i.e., Windows 11.</p>
<h4 id="In-this-article"><a href="#In-this-article" class="headerlink" title="In this article"></a>In this article</h4><p>01 <a href="#part1">Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows</a></p>

<h2 id="Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows"><a href="#Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows"></a>Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows</h2><p>Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>

<li><strong>Kamojis</strong> – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.</p>
<p>Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.iemoji.com/" >http://www.iemoji.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and using the options that the website offers.

<h2 id="Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows-3"><a href="#Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows"></a>Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows</h2><p>Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) or <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>.</strong> (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>)</strong> (right brace) will create a smiley face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>(</strong> (left brace) will create a sad face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) will create a wink face</p>

In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.</p>
<h3 id="The-significant-elements-are"><a href="#The-significant-elements-are" class="headerlink" title="The significant elements are:"></a><strong>The significant elements are:</strong></h3><ul>
<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.</p>
<p>To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.</p>

How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all.

<h3 id="The-significant-elements-are-3"><a href="#The-significant-elements-are-3" class="headerlink" title="The significant elements are:"></a><strong>The significant elements are:</strong></h3><ul>
<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/emojis.jpg"
                      alt="what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g.

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img

<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>

<p>If you ever wondered <strong>what is emoji</strong>, and how the term relates (or unrelates) to its elder sibling emoticon, you are at the right place. In the following sections, you will learn some quite interesting facts about the two, what different types of emojis are available, and what do they mean.</p>
<p>Because understanding the meaning of emojis is more important as compared to knowing <strong>what is an emoji</strong> itself, here you will get all the related details, relevant answers, and some best practice tips.</p>
<h2 id="Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-2"><a href="#Part-1-What-Is-an-Emoji-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: What Is an Emoji?"></a>Part 1: What Is an Emoji?</h2><p><img

                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="what is Emoji"
                ></p>
<p>In a nutshell, an emoji is a graphical image that reflects a certain facial expression. Emojis are created using a drawing tool, and are incorporated into a unique 16-bit Unicode in order to make them compatible with operating systems of the most common devices and platforms like iOS, Android, macOS, and Windows.</p>
<p>In addition to being merely a picture, emojis are also <strong>animated</strong> to exaggerate the message senders’ emotions. You can find a couple of decent examples of such animations while using Skype messenger.</p>
<p>The reason behind emojis being more popular than the emoticons used earlier is the close resemblance of the former to the real-like expressions that they reflect when sent to a recipient. Therefore, it would be safe to say that a single emoji could be worth several sentences while texting if used correctly.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-2"><a href="#Part-2-What-are-the-Differences-Between-Emojis-and-Emoticons-2" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?"></a>Part 2: What are the Differences Between Emojis and Emoticons?</h2><p>As explained earlier, the emojis are graphical and sometimes animated Unicode illustrations that can be included in the text messages as objects.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the emoticons are formed using the ASCII characters, and no specific coding is required at the users’ side to create them. Simply put, an emoticon can be easily added to a text message or even to an email merely by using a combination of letters on the keyboard.</p>
<p>For instance, to create an emoticon of a smiley face, all you need to do is, type a colon sign along with a closing brace. (E.g. Typing a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>)</strong> without space will become a smiling face, a <strong>:</strong> and <strong>(</strong> will form a sad face, and so on).</p>
<p>To be clearer, emojis can be considered an advanced, better, and evolved version of emoticons. While the latter can be formed using simple characters like letters and symbols, the former is inserted as an object in the text messages.</p>
