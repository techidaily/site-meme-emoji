In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.</p>
<h3 id="The-significant-elements-are"><a href="#The-significant-elements-are" class="headerlink" title="The significant elements are:"></a><strong>The significant elements are:</strong></h3><ul>
<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>

Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, you can use the same menu as Windows and Mac to upload emoji.</p>
<p>Discord’s interface is similar across all devices, so the following steps work on Android and Apple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

                ></p>
<ul>
<li>As the channel and server list opens for Discord, you can see a three-dot menu right next to the channel list with the server name. Tap on it to proceed.</li>
<li>To get to your server settings, press “Settings” in the Discord server menu that shows up.</li>
<li>Under the “Server Settings” menu, select “Emoji” to access the custom emoji settings.</li>
<li>As the “Emoji” menu opens, you can see an emoji requirement list</li>
<li>Press “Upload Emoji” to upload any emoji that aligns with these requirements</li>
<li>Press the custom emoji file, tap “Crop” if it needs cropping, and then use the “Upload” option</li>
<li>After you upload the emoji file, replace the alias tag by tapping on it. This will redirect you to that specific emoji’s settings</li>
<li>Type the name you want using the “Alias” box to create the tag used to insert emoji in messages</li>
<li>Save this new tag with the “Save” icon placed in the bottom right</li>
<li>Any changes you make to the custom emoji’s alias are applied to it instantly for your use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emoji bring fun to the conversations you have with friends, and it is very easy to add them to your server as well. These show up in the emoji pop-up list once you add them. The chat message bar contains the emoji icon from where you can access them.</p>
<p>It is essential to name your emoji with only alphanumeric characters and underscores using at least two characters.</p>
<p>The Discord emoji size is 32x32 pixels, so even if you upload up to 128x128 pixel size emojis, they will be resized to the default dimensions. Furthermore, emoji file sizes are at most 256kb.</p>
<p>If you want to use custom emojis, you can’t do so without a Nitro subscription because it is only functional on the server they are uploaded to. Even if you find a way to access the emoji from some other server, only its text code will be visible.</p>
<p>If you attempt to use the Emoji Picker to pick an emoji, you’ll get the following message:</p>

<p>Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.</p>
<p>You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.</p>

                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>

<p>We all love traveling and for a good reason. It allows us to relax, it removes the pressure from our life and it just makes the entire experience a lot better. But if you are a fan of taking picture while travelling, why not try to create a video slideshow with your images? This is one of the best and most original ways you can use it in order to share your travels with others. It works magically and it manages to bring in front some of those unique moments. However, you do need to have the proper tools when you want to create such a slideshow, but that’s great as we are here to help you with that.</p>

<p>Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.</p>
<p>You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.</p>

<p>Creating a unique slideshow video with this tool is actually very easy and it does provide you with a huge amount of value should you choose to use it. Here are several things you need to consider when making a travel slideshow video. First, choose the right music for the travel slideshow; second, adjust the duration of the photos; third, transitions and effects.</p>
<p>Here are the steps you need to focus on when creating a travel slideshow video with Wondershare Filmora:</p>
<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>

Because Windows 10 offers a great range of emojis that help you express your feelings and reactions in fewer words, they have recently gained a decent level of popularity, mostly amongst youngsters and millennials.</p>
<p>With that said, in the following sections, you will learn <strong>how to use emojis on Windows 10</strong> using both keyboard shortcuts and touch keyboard, <strong>how to get emojis on Windows 10</strong> to make your text or conversation look more versatile, and what new has been added to the latest operating system released by Microsoft, i.e., Windows 11.</p>

With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) or <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>.</strong> (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard</li>
</ul>

                      alt="use emojis on windows shortcuts"
                ></p>
<p>Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.</p>
<p>As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>)</strong> (right brace) will create a smiley face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>(</strong> (left brace) will create a sad face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) will create a wink face</p>
<p>…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:</p>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While the emojis were introduced to Windows as late as 2012, Windows 11 has a wide range of these virtual objects or faces for various occasions and to convey different expressions respectively. Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.</p>
<p>Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.iemoji.com/" >http://www.iemoji.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and using the options that the website offers.

<h2 id="Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows-1"><a href="#Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows"></a>Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows</h2><p>Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-1"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-1" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) or <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>.</strong> (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard</li>
</ul>

<p>Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.</p>
<p>As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>)</strong> (right brace) will create a smiley face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>(</strong> (left brace) will create a sad face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) will create a wink face</p>
<p>…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:</p>

<li><strong>Kamojis</strong> – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(</li>

<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>
<p>While the emojis were introduced to Windows as late as 2012, Windows 11 has a wide range of these virtual objects or faces for various occasions and to convey different expressions respectively. Furthermore, Windows 11 also gives you access to Tenor’s GIFs, and ASCII characters with particular combinations to represent the emojis, as it was done back in the days of button-operated cellphones.</p>
<p>Also, if the built-in emoji keyboard doesn’t have your favorite expressions and smileys, you can always generate your custom ones by going to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="http://www.iemoji.com/" >http://www.iemoji.com/ <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, and using the options that the website offers. All in all, it’s easy to learn <strong>how to use emojis on Windows</strong> as long as you have access to the correct tutorial that explains the process in an easy manner.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows-3"><a href="#Part-1-The-History-of-Emojis-in-Windows-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows"></a>Part 1: The History of Emojis in Windows</h2><p>Although emojis are present in some form or the other since the mid-‘90s, they were not quite popular back then. With the evolution of smartphones, these iconic characters got attention from the then-teenagers. Seeing this, in 2012, Microsoft introduced the first-ever set of black-and-white emojis with the release of Windows 8, and after some time, the company also added the same to Windows 7 that was rolled out along with the updates for the OS.</p>
<p>With the release of Windows 10 in 2015, a wide range of full-fledged colored emojis was introduced and received a large number of positive reactions from the users. As of today, emojis have become an integral part of everyone’s day-to-day text conversation, be it on Skype, WhatsApp, Facebook, or any other such platform.</p>
<h2 id="Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-3"><a href="#Part-2-How-to-Use-Emojis-with-Keyboard-Shortcuts-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts"></a>Part 2: How to Use Emojis with Keyboard Shortcuts</h2><p>A keyboard shortcut is a combination of two or more keys that are pressed simultaneously to trigger a pre-assigned event or action. A good example of a keyboard shortcut is ‘Ctrl + S’ which, when pressed, saves the document you’re working on.</p>
<p>While learning the process of <strong>how to use emoji in Windows 10</strong>, it is equally imperative to memorize the shortcut keys to insert those icons without taking your hands off the keyboard. This not only saves your time, but it also prevents you from going through the lengthy process of opening the emojis keyboard, navigating through all the available icons to choose the one you’re looking for, and then clicking it to insert in the document or conversation.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to learn how to launch the emojis keyboard, and the process is simple. All you need to do is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure that your keyboard cursor is in an app that can accept text inputs. A text editor like MS Word or WordPad could be a good example</li>
<li>Press the <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) or <strong>Windows</strong> + <strong>.</strong> (period) keys together to open the emojis keyboard</li>
</ul>

                      alt="use emojis on windows shortcuts"
                ></p>
<p>Once the keyboard is open, you can click any of the available emojis to insert it in your conversion or text content.</p>
<p>As for the shortcuts, depending on the type of expression you want to convey, there could be thousands of them. Some of the commonly used emojis and their universal shortcut keys for both Windows 10 and Windows 11 include:</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>)</strong> (right brace) will create a smiley face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>(</strong> (left brace) will create a sad face</p>
<p><strong>:</strong> (colon) + <strong>;</strong> (semicolon) will create a wink face</p>
<p>…and so on. You can conduct a quick online search to get the entire list of keyboard shortcuts and the emojis that they will create. For your convenience, a link from the Microsoft official website is given below:</p>

You can follow the instructions given below to enable touch keyboard, and then learn <strong>how to use emojis on Windows</strong> 11 or Windows 10 via touch:</p>

<p>In Windows 11, although you can launch the emojis keyboard using the same shortcuts, i.e., ‘Windows + .’ or ‘Windows + ;’ keys as mentioned earlier, the emojis keyboard itself has four sections, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Emojis</strong> – Contains various emojis and smileys</li>
<li><strong>GIF</strong> – Gives you access to various animated GIFs from Tenor</li>
<li><strong>Kamojis</strong> – Lets you add the ASCII characters for emojis, e.g., :-) or :-(</li>
<li><strong>Symbols</strong> – To add important symbols to your text, e.g., ©, ®, etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to this, the 2D Clippy emoji has also been introduced with Windows 11, and can be located by launching the emojis keyboard, and typing ‘Clippy’.</p>
