<p> Your baby grows up very fast and being able to see him grow is maybe one of the most interesting and exciting moments in your life. Documenting the first year is amazing and it will surely offer you an extraordinary value so try to do that the best way you can. Imagine how touched your child would be when he&#x2F;she, at the age of 18, watch something like this:</p>
<h2 id="How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video"><a href="#How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video" class="headerlink" title="How to make the baby’s first year video"></a>How to make the baby’s first year video</h2><p><strong>Filming tips</strong></p>
<p> Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize the camera</strong> - The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong> - You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong> - Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> - Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing tips</strong></p>
<p> Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.</p>

<p><strong>Adjust saturation</strong> - You should try to use the app in order to adjust the saturation as this can lead to some very bad results if you’re not careful. Find the proper saturation levels and opt for them right away.</p>
<p><strong>Trim, cut, or split</strong> - If needed, split, cut or even trim the video. There will be times when you will need the reversing effect as well. All of these effects are accessible via the Wondershare Filmora video app.</p>
<p><strong>Advanced editing</strong> - Plus, you will also need to apply a green screen effect as this will help you place your baby in a variety of funny locations, be it a funny MV or a Hollywood movie. The app can also help you clone the baby with PIP effects and you can also use it to add filters, overlays or text.</p>
<p> Wondershare Filmora will offer you an extraordinary set of tools and it will bring in front a very good value right from the start.

<h2 id="How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video-3"><a href="#How-to-make-the-baby’s-first-year-video-3" class="headerlink" title="How to make the baby’s first year video"></a>How to make the baby’s first year video</h2><p><strong>Filming tips</strong></p>
<p> Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize the camera</strong> - The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong> - You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong> - Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> - Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing tips</strong></p>
<p> Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end. With that in mind, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Wondershare Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> can be the tool of choice as it offers you all the features you need in order to create a good baby video.</p>

<p> Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we’ve all made more foolish assumptions than we’d care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they’ve become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the <em>Hood Documentary</em> series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: ‘<em>You can’t be broke if you don’t check your bank account’</em> went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.</p>
<p> Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we’re going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme</h2><p> Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you’d like to achieve.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"

                ></p>
<p><em>Can’t lose</em> <em>if you don’t play</em> is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don’t try something you can’t fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it’s not, and that’s the catch.</p>

There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.</p>

<p> Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we’ve all made more foolish assumptions than we’d care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they’ve become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the <em>Hood Documentary</em> series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: ‘<em>You can’t be broke if you don’t check your bank account’</em> went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.</p>
<p> Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we’re going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.</p>

<p><em>Can’t lose</em> <em>if you don’t play</em> is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don’t try something you can’t fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it’s not, and that’s the catch.</p>

<p> Assumptions can lead you in a very wrong direction, and we’ve all made more foolish assumptions than we’d care to admit. As a matter of fact, seemingly brilliant life strategies are so common that they’ve become a meme. A guy named Reece Simpson made such a stupid and borderline sexist conclusion in one of the episodes of the <em>Hood Documentary</em> series, that it instantly became synonymous with all ideas that look good only in theory. The iconic image of him, placing the index finger to his temple with a comment: ‘<em>You can’t be broke if you don’t check your bank account’</em> went viral only a six months after the documentary was initially released. In less than a week the tweet had 74.000 likes and 47.000 retweets.</p>
<p> Over time numerous variations of the meme emerged on social media, so in this article, we’re going to show you how you can make your own Roll Safe-Think About It memes in less than few minutes. But first, let have a look at some of the successful examples of this meme.</p>
<h2 id="A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme-3"><a href="#A-Few-Good-Examples-of-the-Roll-Safe-Think-About-It-Meme-3" class="headerlink" title="A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme"></a>A Few Good Examples of the Roll Safe-Think About It Meme</h2><p> Being slightly ironic while making a seemingly valid point is the true spirit of the Roll-Safe-Think About It meme, which is why using just any off the wall idea may not have the effect you’d like to achieve.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/roll-safe-think-about-it-upload-1.jpg"
                     
                ></p>
<p><em>Can’t lose</em> <em>if you don’t play</em> is a great illustration of what Roll Safe is all about. If you don’t try something you can’t fail at it, right? The assumption seems entirely legitimate, except it’s not, and that’s the catch.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload

                ></p>
<p> A similar logic can be applied to romance, as there is zero chance to get cheated on if you weren’t in a relationship, to begin with. The only trouble is that if you adopt this way of thinking, you’ll never be in a relationship.</p>

                ></p>
<p> We all complain about financial troubles in one way or the other, and Roll Safe-Think About It offers a pretty funny way to do that. Once again, a seemingly valid point that only looks good in theory is the punch-line of the meme. There are so many different variations of this meme on the Internet, at the moment, but nearly all of them employ faulty logic to create the comical effect.</p>

Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.</p>
<p>You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video.

<p>There are only nine emojis available in the Filmora’s built-in Emojis category, but you can easily broaden the range of emoji genres you have the access to by downloading the <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Animated Emoji Pack <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> from <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >Filmstock effects store <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>. You don’t have to spend any additional money on this pack that contains <strong>24 different emojis</strong>, but you must create an account on Filmstock before you can download the Animated Emoji Pack to your computer. The process of adding the emojis from this pack to videos is the same as the process of adding one of the emojis from the built-in Emojis category. Filmstock is so much more than an endless source of emojis for your videos since it offers a variety of visual and audio stock footage and visual effects. Even if you are using Adobe After Effects, you can also download and use some visual effects templates for AE.</p>

Bonus: Animate Sticker and Emojis Your Download from Internet with Filmora</h4><p>Instead of adding pre-animated ideograms to your videos, you can simply download a still image of a sticker or an emoji and animate it with Filmora. However, you should search for emojis that have a transparent background in order to blend it quicker with the source footage. Once you find a smiley or any other emoji you’d like to add to a video you should save it on your hard drive and import it into a project in Filmora.</p>
<p>You should then place the emoji at the exact spot on the timeline where you want it to appear in the final cut of the video. Double-click on the still image file and proceed to adjust its size or position from the Transform menu or choose a motion effect from the Motion tab. When done, commence the rendering process by clicking on the Export button.

The Kapwing Meme Maker tool doesn’t feature any built-in stickers or emojis, so you must either upload a still image with a transparent ground to the platform or use its Text tool to add emojis to a video. Moreover, you won’t be able to animate the emojis you add to video clips with the Kapwing Meme Maker tool since the Kapwing platform doesn’t offer any animation tools. Despite this Kapwing is still one of the best online video editing platforms you can use to add emojis and stickers to videos.</p>

So, if you can’t find the emoji that fits perfectly to your video you should head over to <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://emojipedia.org/" >emojipedia <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> or any other website that lets you download thousands of emojis for free.

It is also worth noting that the emojis you download from the Internet should have a transparent background and that they should be saved in the PNG file format.</p>
