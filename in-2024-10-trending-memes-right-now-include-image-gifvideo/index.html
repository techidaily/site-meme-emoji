<p> Shooting a good baby’s first year video can take a little bit of preparation and it will surely offer you an extraordinary experience in the long run. It will also help offer you an incredible value to begin with which is always impressive.</p>
<p><strong>Stabilize the camera</strong> - The first thing you need to do is to stabilize the camera. Using a tripod can be the best option here so take your time and results will be great for sure. Of course, placing the camera on your counter will also help, so try to keep that in mind as it can indeed be a very good option to begin with.</p>
<p><strong>Lighting</strong> - You will also have to play with the proper lighting setup. A good light will help you get much better results and even though it can take some time to get the best experience, it really is a truly amazing option that you do not want to miss.</p>
<p><strong>Focus</strong> - Of course, focus on the baby. Yes, focus but don’t zoom in and out all the time. Find a good pattern that will help keep the baby steady and do all in your power to get the best results. Granted, it will take some time to get good results but don’t rush it otherwise the experience will not be as good as you would expect.</p>
<p><strong>Audio</strong> - Moreover, audio should be your focus here as well. Take the time and do something good here, a good audio will always pay off very well so get a good audio setup if you want to obtain a stellar experience.</p>
<p><strong>Props</strong> - Also, we recommend you to use props. These can really make a good video and they will even add in some much needed fun to your setup. Try to find the best possible props and add them in your video. Some good prop examples would be a stuffed animal, a toy, maybe even the family pet. All of these are great and well worth your time.</p>
<p><strong>Editing tips</strong></p>
<p> Once you finished capturing the movie, you will have to go to editing. This is where you have to use a good video editing tool that will help provide a good baby’s first year video in the end.

<p>When you click on the ‘T’ icon, a text box is going to appear over the picture. Click on the box labeled ‘Text’ for bringing inserting the caption.</p>
<p>If you want, you can change the alignment, color, italics, bolding, font, and underline, too.</p>

Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important.

<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.</p>

Businesses can join in on creating memes that will be suitable for their brand. However, while creating a meme, a business or an individual needs to keep a few things in mind.</p>
<ol>
<li>Be Witty</li>
</ol>
<p>The point of a meme is basically to be fun and silly. However, in the depth of it, you will find a witty connotation. This ties it to something more grave and important. So, the subject matter of the meme doesn’t have to be serious, but if you relate it to a far-reaching topic adding a witty comment will make the meme popular.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Creating Memes off Existing and Successful Trends</li>
</ol>
<p>You should play off the existing trend. This is a popular method that is used by many across the web. By adapting a video in trend, you can add your own spin to it. This method is particularly known as memejacking.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Use Good Quality Video and Images</li>
</ol>
<p>You might think that for a meme you do not quality video or image. However, that is not true. Even the picture frame that you are adding is important. Keep in mind that everything inside the meme is communicating something. The absence of something is also communicating certain things. Hence, unless you really mean to post a bad quality video or photo, make sure you do your best to get top-quality content.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>Consider If It Works for the Audience</li>
</ol>
<p>There is an audience for everything over the social media channels. However, meme-makers often tend to forget how personal it is. So, when you are making a joke, you have to make sure others are getting it. Simply because something is in trend, you shouldn’t go for it. You should only post it if it works for the brand of your profile.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

<p>If you’re on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It’s free and open-source. In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>
<p>The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.</p>
<p>If you’re working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you’re done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-4"><a href="#Conclusion-4" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

<p>If you’re on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It’s free and open-source. In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>
<p>The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>It doesn’t have to be stressful to create a storyboard, and Canva makes it easy with a large library of templates, millions of stock photos (or the ability to upload your own), and color frames. The font type, colors, headers, and subheaders can be customized.</p>
<p>If you’re working on a script or design with someone else, you can grant access to collaborate, and when you’re done you can share the design through email or as a PDF. On the other hand, if your team needs an easy and simple tool to manage simpler projects or get started with storyboarding, this may be your best choice.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>

<p>Several different creative sectors rely on storyboarding for their creative process, including filmmakers and animators and UX designers, game designers, and creative directors. However, the process of hand-drawing each frame or shot can take a great deal of time if you have to do it by hand. Our goal is to make storyboarding easier and more efficient by bringing you this list of free and paid tools, storyboarding software, and apps.</p>
<p>You can add text, sound, and script to your original sketches with these tools (or make use of assets from a library if you do not have time to sketch your own). Alternatively, you can share your storyboarding progress within the project, either by a link or a PDF - or get immediate feedback. Finally, you can continue working from anywhere with apps that work across multiple devices - desktop, mobile, and tablet.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of tool you prefer, from a simple 2D sketch tool like Make Storyboard to a 3D drawing tool like Storyboard Pro, you’ll find the best options on this page.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you’re on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It’s free and open-source. In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>
<p>The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.</p>
<h4 id="2-Toon-Boom-Storyboard-Pro-2"><a href="#2-Toon-Boom-Storyboard-Pro-2" class="headerlink" title="2. Toon Boom Storyboard Pro"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro</strong></h4><p>Price: $60&#x2F;mo or $999 one-time fee</p>

<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>

                ></p>
<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>In the software industry, online SaaS products have quickly become the norm. While desktop programs are not going away, we see more and more web-based options such as Boards that provide unique solutions.</p>
<p>The Boards software is a native storyboard platform that provides tons of free templates and collaboration tools. In addition, clients can log into their projects and add comments directly from their computers.</p>
<p>For teams working together on a project, you may also set up multiple user accounts. Storyboards in Boords can be presented in animatic form before being animated, thanks to flexible frame sizes and tons of free templates.</p>
<p>Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it’s right for you, but there is no commitment involved.</p>

                ></p>
<p>If you’re on a smaller budget, Storyboarder is an excellent option. It’s free and open-source. In the program’s clean interface, you have all the tools you need, so drawing shapes and characters is a breeze. In addition to writing dialogue, you can also enter timing information and the type of shot.</p>
<p>The Storyboarder and Photoshop apps integrate seamlessly, which means you can refine your board in Photoshop and have it updated in Storyboarder. In addition, you can export videos to Premiere, Final Cut, Avid, PDF, or Animated GIF from this software.</p>
<h4 id="2-Toon-Boom-Storyboard-Pro-3"><a href="#2-Toon-Boom-Storyboard-Pro-3" class="headerlink" title="2. Toon Boom Storyboard Pro"></a><strong>2.</strong> <strong>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro</strong></h4><p>Price: $60&#x2F;mo or $999 one-time fee</p>
<p>Platforms: Mac, Windows</p>

                ></p>
<p>Toon Boom Storyboard Pro is the complete opposite of free. A standout among storyboarding programs, it’s also one of the most expensive. However, in most studios, boarding and animating is done using Toon Boom, so you may want to learn about this if you’d like to break into the industry. As a result, the monthly fee is a lot lower than the initial cost, allowing most people to take advantage of the service.</p>
<p>You can use Toon Boom for a month and test the waters before committing yourself to a huge license fee. How can you benefit from this program? Sketching and animation go hand-in-hand in this process. Drawing your boards and seeing how they would animate is a great way to test your script while making sure you’re on target with your scenes.</p>
<p>The program is primarily designed for animators. It can be used for ad agencies and for making small skits. Nevertheless, the Story Flow tool makes switching between board and script for writers incredibly easy. In addition to creating dynamic camera movements, you can also use some 3D effects that work well for 3D animators. Create layered panels in Photoshop quickly and easily by importing Final Draft scripts. There is plenty of support available for all the common programs in the art industry.</p>
<h4 id="3-Plot-3"><a href="#3-Plot-3" class="headerlink" title="3. Plot"></a><strong>3. Plot</strong></h4><p>Price: $10&#x2F;month (14 days Free Trial Available)</p>

                      alt="plot-poster"
                ></p>
<p>Storytelling is super easy with the plot. There are no limits to the number of boards, projects, and users you can have. With some nice features targeted toward animators, it is a web-based storyboarding app for beginners.</p>
<p>A drawing pane is available on whichever operating system you run this program on. Drawing your frames this way also lets you add dialogues and stage directions directly to your project. In addition, it is easy to move through different scenes in the app because it is visual. You can click and drag pieces around to change the scene. It couldn’t be easier.</p>
<p>In addition to the collaboration features, we consider it to be exceptional and above the norm for products in this price range. As long as you have a desktop program to work on your drawings, you’ll have more control. When you import the drawings into Plot, you can then arrange them accordingly. Hence, you’ve still got collaborative features with online management of very detailed drawings.</p>

<p>Despite the affordable monthly price, this product works on every major operating system. It is rare to find a program that offers this much functionality at such an affordable price. Boords is an excellent solution for collaborative work. You can try it for a while until you decide if it’s right for you, but there is no commitment involved.</p>

<p>I think it will stay around for a long time. It’s been around for 20+ years. Yet, doesn’t it seem funny how Photoshop can be used for so much more than photo editing? In addition to storyboarding, we see it used for digital painting, pixel art, etc. The digital drawing capability of PS is the same as that of other programs. There are now more brushes available for the PS environment, so there’s even more support.</p>
<p>Additionally, you can download free storyboard templates in PSD format for Photoshop. This program doesn’t need too much explanation because every artist is already aware of it. However, Linux users are most likely to be disappointed by the lack of support.</p>
<h4 id="Conclusion-7"><a href="#Conclusion-7" class="headerlink" title="Conclusion"></a><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4><p>So, these are some of the best free and paid to storyboard software that you can find in 2021. Each piece of software has its own characteristics and way of being used. In the end, it all depends upon your usage and preferences to decide which software you will use to achieve your goals. If you have enough budget then you can work with paid tools as they offer more features. If you have limited or no budget, you can try to free tools as they offer pretty good features.</p>

Whether you have an iPhone or an Android, you can use the same menu as Windows and Mac to upload emoji.</p>
<p>Discord’s interface is similar across all devices, so the following steps work on Android and Apple.</p>
<ul>
<li>Begin by opening the app on your device to access the server. Press the hamburger menu located at the top left in an open server and channel.</li>
</ul>
<p><img

<li>As the channel and server list opens for Discord, you can see a three-dot menu right next to the channel list with the server name. Tap on it to proceed.</li>
<li>To get to your server settings, press “Settings” in the Discord server menu that shows up.</li>
<li>Under the “Server Settings” menu, select “Emoji” to access the custom emoji settings.</li>
<li>As the “Emoji” menu opens, you can see an emoji requirement list</li>
<li>Press “Upload Emoji” to upload any emoji that aligns with these requirements</li>
<li>Press the custom emoji file, tap “Crop” if it needs cropping, and then use the “Upload” option</li>
<li>After you upload the emoji file, replace the alias tag by tapping on it. This will redirect you to that specific emoji’s settings</li>
<li>Type the name you want using the “Alias” box to create the tag used to insert emoji in messages</li>
<li>Save this new tag with the “Save” icon placed in the bottom right</li>
<li>Any changes you make to the custom emoji’s alias are applied to it instantly for your use.</li>
</ul>
<p>Emoji bring fun to the conversations you have with friends, and it is very easy to add them to your server as well. These show up in the emoji pop-up list once you add them. The chat message bar contains the emoji icon from where you can access them.</p>
<p>It is essential to name your emoji with only alphanumeric characters and underscores using at least two characters.</p>
<p>The Discord emoji size is 32x32 pixels, so even if you upload up to 128x128 pixel size emojis, they will be resized to the default dimensions. Furthermore, emoji file sizes are at most 256kb.</p>
<p>If you want to use custom emojis, you can’t do so without a Nitro subscription because it is only functional on the server they are uploaded to. Even if you find a way to access the emoji from some other server, only its text code will be visible.</p>
<p>If you attempt to use the Emoji Picker to pick an emoji, you’ll get the following message:</p>

You need the server owner to toggle the permission of Manager Emoji in your domain.</p>
<p>On the other hand, as a server owner, you can give others this role with the following steps.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Open Roles:</strong> Open the Server Settings and select “Roles” from the menu on the side.</li>
<li><strong>Toggle Manage Emoji:</strong> Pick the role you want to apply the permission to, and then toggle emoji’s slider to “on,” save changes, and you’re done!</li>

Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-select-image.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-background.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid Background"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>

Both Play Store and iTunes can offer a good number of these apps to create memes having white background. Here, we are considering an Android phone for that matter.</p>
<p> Step by step guide for creating memes with white background –</p>
<p> Step 1: From the Play Store, download the app on your Android phone. Run the app on your mobile device and click on the ‘Grid’ for selecting the image that you wish to add to your meme.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-select-image.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid import image"
                ></p>
<p> Step 2: When the picture is loaded on Photo Grid, you need to click on the ‘Background’ tab from the menu at the bottom. Pick white color from the menu over here, though usually it is selected by default.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/PhotoGrid-background.JPG"
                      alt="PhotoGrid Background"
                ></p>
<p> Step 3: Adjust the position and size of the image as you desire by pinching and zooming with your fingers. Once the position and dimensions are fixed as per your requirements, hit the ‘Text’ option. Enter the text you want to include in the meme and then click the ‘tick’ box.</p>
<p> Step 4: Your text is movable across the image area and is resizable as well using your fingers. You can alter the alignment, font, border, color etc. for every text you enter here.</p>
<p> Step 5: When everything else is sorted, press the ‘NEXT’ button on the top corner and hit ‘Save’. This is how to make memes with white background.</p>
<p> Using Photo Grid, you can also create video memes following the same guide as that of the photo memes. As everything is created in a square size, you can seamlessly use it on any social media platform including Reddit, Instagram, etc.</p>
