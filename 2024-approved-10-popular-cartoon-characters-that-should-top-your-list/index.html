<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation.

Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.</p>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"
                      alt="export slideshow with travel photos "
                ></p>

<p><a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-and-filmstock.jpg" >Filmstock Stock Media Library <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>](<a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora_web&source_channel=seo_article" >https://filmstock.wondershare.com/creative-theme-tourism?spm=rs.filmora%5Fweb&amp;source%5Fchannel=seo%5Farticle <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>)</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Download and install Wondershare Filmora, then open it.</p>
<p>Add all the travel photos into the applications. You can add in multiple folders in order to make sorting the images a lot easier.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/import-travel-photos-video-to-filmora.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - import"
                ></p>
<p>Next, set up the photo duration to the desired length, so that you don’t need to adjust the photo duration one by one.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/preference-settings.jpg"
                      alt="Set up travel photo duration"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Now, it’s time to determine and add music in the background. Add some sounds and royalty-free music in Wondershare Filmora and then use the media library to help you give more of an impact to the entire experience.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-audio-library.jpg"
                      alt="Add music on travel photo slideshow"
                ></p>
<p>If you want to sync the photo to the background music, you can <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://tools.techidaily.com/wondershare/filmora/download/" >use the Beat Detection tool in Filmora <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a> and mark the highlights accordingly.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you did that, you will have to drag and then drop the images directly to the timeline. Here is where you can change things like saturation, hue, brightness, contrast and other features.</p>
<p>You can also rotate the images and crop them if you see fit. If some of the travel photos have different aspect ratios, you can select Crop to Fit so all the photos will be in the same aspect ratio without blackbar.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/adjust-travel-photo-transform.jpg"
                      alt="How to make video slideshow with travel photos - adjust transform"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> At this point, you do need to try and add transitions between each of the images.</p>
<p>When you are done with that, you have to select the filters and overlays that will help you make your travel slideshow look better. This is an important step and you do want to spend a good amount of time with it.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora9-transition-library.jpg"
                      alt="add transition to  travel photos video slideshow"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> Lastly, you will have to export the slideshow as you see fit, but you also have the option to share it on YouTube if you so desire.</p>
<p><img  
                     lazyload
                     src="/images/loading.svg"
                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/filmora-export-interface.jpg"
                      alt="export slideshow with travel photos "
                ></p>

<p>We all love traveling and for a good reason. It allows us to relax, it removes the pressure from our life and it just makes the entire experience a lot better. But if you are a fan of taking picture while travelling, why not try to create a video slideshow with your images? This is one of the best and most original ways you can use it in order to share your travels with others. It works magically and it manages to bring in front some of those unique moments. However, you do need to have the proper tools when you want to create such a slideshow, but that’s great as we are here to help you with that.</p>

<p>Before you create the travel slideshow you have to keep in mind a few things. If you don’t then the results will not be as good as you expect. You have to be committed to the idea of having the best results and as long as you do that the outcome will be very well worth it.</p>
<p>You need to try and consider your audience because based on that the slideshow will have a specific format. You also need to think about telling a story as that will make it a lot more interesting other than just having a bunch of images aligned together in a non-meaningful manner.</p>
