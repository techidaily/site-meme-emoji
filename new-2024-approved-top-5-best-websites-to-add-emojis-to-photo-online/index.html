In short, these are the major elements you need to have grip before starting any stop motion animation.</p>
<h3 id="The-significant-elements-are"><a href="#The-significant-elements-are" class="headerlink" title="The significant elements are:"></a><strong>The significant elements are:</strong></h3><ul>
<li><strong>A thoughtful subject line:</strong> why people watch you stop motion animation, ask the question to yourself and decide a good subject line. If you want to show a story by moving a few objects, characters, and figures, the subject line must have a solid message you want to convey. Otherwise, you will never get your target audience.</li>
<li><strong>Proper planning:</strong> It is an old proverb that creativity is the messy thing in the world. But people will not watch it messy on the screen. How you present the complete story, what kinds of cameras and angles you need to use to get what you want, the background settings, any music you can add or not are part of the planning.</li>
<li><strong>Cameras and angles:</strong> A firm stand tripod, a stationary camera, and lots of careful movement of your object are important elements in stop motion animation. The lights and the angles of your camera decide the result of your efforts. Do not bump your camera during the shoot, or you may lose everything and begin from scratch, which is not a good idea at all. Lights and the shadow angle are even important in stop motion animation creation.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are movements and shoot arrangements, like a few more major elements you must consider while planning to stop motion animation from escalating your creative aspect.</p>
<p>To create stop motion animation, beginners and kids require different objects. Among them, few things are common like cameras, tripods, lights etc. In the case of kids, you can start practicing at home with available items like a big table to keep objects on them. But for beginners, can start from a small studio with various angle lights and camera arrangements.</p>

<p>All recent versions of iPhones and iPads released since 2017 are equipped with a powerful face recognition technology called Face ID, that among numerous other things powers memojis and animojis. Even though these 3D emojis that track and imitate your facial expressions and movements are only accessible from the iMessages app, you can still use them to create funny videos that are going to make your friends on social media smile. On the other hand, the owners of most Android-based devices still have to use third-party apps if they want to make animoji and memoji videos. Read on if you would like to discover the best apps on the market that let you create animoji and memoji videos with ease.</p>

Let’s take a look at some of the best apps you can use to create memoji or animoji videos without any restrictions.</p>
<h4 id="1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces"><a href="#1-Emoji-Me-Animated-Faces" class="headerlink" title="1. Emoji Me Animated Faces"></a>1. Emoji Me Animated Faces</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>The rich selection of animated emojis this app offers is perfectly suited for iPhone users who are looking to expand their collection of animojis. However, the Emoji Me app doesn’t offer customization features, which means that you are not going to be able to create memojis that look like you if you decide to install it on your device. Keep in mind that you are going to need iOS 10 or later in order to use this app on your iPhone, iPad or iPod touch. Emoji Me is a perfect choice if you want to send animojis to your friends via iMessages, Instagram, Facebook, and numerous other social media or messaging apps.</p>
<h4 id="2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder"><a href="#2-EMOJI-Face-Recorder" class="headerlink" title="2. EMOJI Face Recorder"></a>2. EMOJI Face Recorder</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/emoji-face-recorder/id1377084545" >iOS <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a>, Android</p>
<p>You don’t need the latest iPhone or iPad model to record funny animoji videos, because you can download the EMOJI Face Recorder and create this type of video on a broad range of devices that support either the iOS or the Android operating system. You can become a panda, an owl or a shark in just a few taps, but some of the animated characters this app offers are only available if you make an in-app purchase. In addition, you can record your own voice while capturing the facial expressions and movements and create incredible karaoke music videos. Even though the app’s sharing capabilities are far from impressive you can still post all your videos to most popular social media networks.</p>
<h4 id="3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar"><a href="#3-Facemoji-3D-Face-Emoji-Avatar" class="headerlink" title="3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar"></a>3. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS</p>
<p>Did you ever wonder how would you look like if you were a cartoon character? Well, with Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar app you can find out in a matter of minutes. The app lets you customize all of your facial features, and pick the shape of your nose, the color of your eyes or the accessories you want to add to the fictional character you’re creating. Moreover, you can quickly snap a photo of yourself with this app and choose from a variety of moods that reflect how you feel at any given moment. Facemoji 3D Face Emoji Avatar makes it easy to add your creations to group chats and make conversations with your friends more entertaining.</p>
<h4 id="4-Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App"><a href="#4-Supermoji-–-The-Emoji-App" class="headerlink" title="4. Supermoji – The Emoji App"></a>4. Supermoji – The Emoji App</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

                      alt="what-is-emoji"
                ></p>
<p>This is probably the best option on the market for all video content creators who want to make memoji videos effortlessly even if they don’t have an iPhone X or iPad Pro. However, the free version of the app is only available for a few days, and after that period of time, you have to opt for one of the available subscription models. A weekly subscription can be purchased for $15.49, while a monthly subscription model costs $39.99. The Supermoji app lets you generate 3D animated emojis and turn them into captivating social media videos on a broad range of iOS-based devices. Expressing your creativity with masks and face filters this app offers is easy since you just have to select the emoji you like and hit the record button.</p>
<h4 id="5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters"><a href="#5-MRRMRR-–-Faceapp-Filters" class="headerlink" title="5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters"></a>5. MRRMRR – Faceapp Filters</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free, but offers in-app purchases</p>

<p>Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>
<h4 id="6-MSQRD"><a href="#6-MSQRD" class="headerlink" title="6. MSQRD"></a>6. MSQRD</h4><p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> iOS, <a class="link"   target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://msqrd.en.uptodown.com/android" >Android <i class="fa-regular fa-arrow-up-right-from-square fa-sm"></i></a></p>
<p>MSQRD is a perfect solution for all iPhone and Android users who don’t have the latest versions of iOS and Android operating systems installed on their devices but still want to create amusing animoji videos. The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung AR Emojis</strong></p>
<p><strong>Price:</strong> Free</p>
<p><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Samsung Galaxy series.</p>
<p>Much like iPhones, the models from Samsung’s Galaxy series have set the standards of what Smartphones can do for years. That’s why it is hardly surprising that the Samsung Galaxy S9 lets you create memojis directly from the camera app. You just have to tap on the AR Emoji icon and you can start creating your virtual avatar. The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

<p>Besides a rich selection of masks and face filters you can use to create video selfies, the MRRMRR app offers swap faces features as well as a broad spectrum of entertaining animations. The app’s intuitive interface makes the process of recording and sending an animoji or memoji video as effortless as it can possibly be so that you can focus on finding the most creative way to surprise your friends. The only downside is that you can use the MRRMRR app for free only for a limited period of time, after which you have to either purchase a weekly, monthly or an unlimited subscription model.</p>

The rich selection of masks and face filters enable you to experiment with different options while taking video selfies. What’s more, you can broadcast live videos to Facebook with your favorite face mask on. The face swap option can come in handy if you are looking for a way to make group photos you take with your friends even more hilarious and memorable. However, the file sharing capabilities as well as a number of other options this app offers are far from perfect.</p>
<p><strong>Samsung AR Emojis</strong></p>

The AR Emojis let you take photos or record videos that imitate your movements or facial expressions. The technology is still relatively novel and in the future, we can expect Disney’s and Marvel characters to be thrown into the mix. Until then, you can experiment with AR Emojis to create videos that will make your friends laugh.</p>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>

<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>

<p>The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening “Shared Album”. However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.</p>

<p>iPhoto is a photo library familiar to iOS users. It can help you easily organize, store and sort images, and even make a slide show to help you enjoy photos. This is why, even though Apple no longer develops iPhoto, some people use it.</p>
<p><strong>Update:</strong> On April 8, 2015, Apple has launched a new Photos app on OS X Yosemite, which means Apple has stopped developing iPhoto. However, if you like iPhoto, you can still use it.</p>
<p>The following will introduce how to use the iPhoto collage maker on Mac or iPhone. At the end of this article, iPhoto alternative software will serve as your reference.</p>

<h2 id="Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Photo-Collage-in-iPhoto-3"><a href="#Part-1-How-to-Make-a-Photo-Collage-in-iPhoto-3" class="headerlink" title="Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?"></a>Part 1: How to Make a Photo Collage in iPhoto?</h2><p>Here are the quick steps to create a photo collage with iPhoto.</p>
<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Launch iPhoto and click “Events” in the side menu.</p>
<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Hold “Shift” and click each photo you want to include in your photo collage.</p>
<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Click the “+” button in the lower-left corner and select <strong>Card</strong> in the pop-up window.</p>

                     data-src="https://images.wondershare.com/filmora/article-images/iphoto-add-image.JPG"
                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 4:</strong> Choose “Picture Collage”, which should be under the <strong>Any Occasion</strong> section if you are using the iPhoto 11.</p>
<p><strong>Step 5:</strong> You’ll notice that all the templates are sorted based on the occasion.</p>
<p><strong>Step 6:</strong> Drag photos to the template and pick a background, orientation and design.</p>

                      alt="add photo by iphoto"
                ></p>
<p><strong>Step 7:</strong> Click the <strong>Buy</strong> button on the lower right-hand corner of the collage editor, or go to the <strong>Share</strong> menu and email it to yourself or family members.</p>
<p>But before you make a photo collage using iPhoto, here are some important things for you to know:</p>
<ol>
<li>Technically, iPhoto can’t make fancy photo collages like other Photo collages makers on Mac. So don’t expect too much of it. iPhoto only creates greeting cards with a simple collage layout.</li>
<li>The templates iPhoto offers are quite limited and ordinary that you might feel a little disappointed.</li>
<li>iPhoto offers no share options to save photo collages to desktop or to post on Facebook, which is a basic feature of picture collage editor.</li>
</ol>

<p>The best thing is that you can view iCloud photos anytime and anywhere after logging in to your iCloud account. You can also automatically share photos with others by opening “Shared Album”. However, if there are too many photos, a paid subscription may be required to upgrade the storage space.</p>

<p>Are you a memes lover? Reddit is the best hub for funny memes. However, all of the hilarious memes are deep under several subreddits. As these subreddits cover various topics, it can be difficult to find the most hysterical memes out of all.</p>
<p>So, in this article, we have come up with 10 funniest subreddits to make you laugh. You need not worry further that you are unable to find the memes.</p>
<h2 id="10-Funniest-Subreddits-to-Find-Memes-2"><a href="#10-Funniest-Subreddits-to-Find-Memes-2" class="headerlink" title="10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes"></a>10 Funniest Subreddits to Find Memes</h2><h3 id="1-r-AdviceAnimals-2"><a href="#1-r-AdviceAnimals-2" class="headerlink" title="1. &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals"></a>1. &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals</h3><p>On 7th December 2010, the &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals subreddit was created. It is simple and straight to understand. Advice Animals was firstly a memes category that showed memes like a business cat wearing a coat and tie or socially awkward penguin lacking confidence with some message or awful advice placed over the image.</p>
<p>The funniest subreddits on &#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals showed a Penguin with head and half body with the red background looking left, but the other half of the body and the feet turn right with a blue background. The memes read “Started going to the gym - Only at midnight, so there’s nobody else there.”&#x2F;r&#x2F;AdviceAnimals subreddit showed it as “there’s someone else in the gym, so I left and made memes instead.”</p>

There’s no real money involved, but when a meme starts becoming popular, people opt to buy, and when emaciated, you sell.</p>
<p>For instance, the frustration of a father is making him invest. The memes show a man sitting on the wall looking down and making his face, thinking when your son starts Fortnite dancing in public. You should have made sandwiches instead of making him.</p>

Not in the cage but laughing at you.” Dedicating this song to a friend can create a laugh riot.</p>
